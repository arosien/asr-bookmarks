      <p><b>What is Music?: Solving a Scientific Mystery</b> is a book by <a href="author.html"><b>Philip Dorrell</b></a> which explains a new scientific theory about music: the <b>super-stimulus theory</b>.</p>
      <p>The main idea of the theory is that music is a <b>super-stimulus</b> for the
perception of <b>musicality</b>, where "musicality" is actually a perceived property of <b>speech</b>.
"Musicality" refers to the property of music that determines how "good" it is, how strong an
emotional effect it has, and how much we enjoy listening to it.</p>
      <p>The theory implies that <b>ordinary speech</b> also has this property, in a manner which may vary as a person speaks. The <b>musicality
of speech</b> is much more subtle than that of music, but it provides important 
information which the <b>listener's</b> brain processes (without conscious awareness of the processing), in 
order to derive some information about the <b>internal mental state</b> of the <b>speaker</b>. 
This information is applied to modulate
the listener's <b>emotional response</b> to speech, and this accounts for the <b>emotional effect of music</b>.</p>
      <p>What distinguishes the super-stimulus theory from <b>all other serious attempts</b> to explain music scientifically is
that it starts from a simple assumption that <b>music perception</b> must be 
an <b>information processing function</b>, and
this assumption results in quite specific explanations of 
how major aspects of music such as <b>scales</b>, <b>regular beat</b> and <b>harmony</b> are processed
in the brain. It is the first theory to explain the perception of musical scales without a priori 
assuming the <i>existence</i> of musical scales. (The theory has to do this, because it is a theory of
music perception as an aspect of <i>speech</i> perception, and musical scales do not occur in normal speech.)</p>
      <p>The book is now available as a <a href="download.html"><b>free download</b></a>.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately it is not currently possible to purchase retail copies of the printed book. (If you wish
to purchase large quantities, please contact me by email.)</p>

      <p>These days there are many theories about scientific subjects proposed by
those outside the mainstream. An immediate problem with most of them is that they
ignore or contradict orthodox science.</p>
      <p>I will admit that my theory is not part of the "mainstream" of music science, 
but the scientific assumptions underlying the <b>super-stimulus theory</b> are very orthodox 
indeed. (<a href="articles/ScientificallyOrthodox.html">Read more ...</a>)</p>

      <div class="ideasHeading">Important Ideas about Music</div>
      <div class="idea">
      <p class="ideaHeading">The study of music is part of biology.</p>
      <p class="explanation">Music exists because people create it, perform it and listen to it.
People are living organisms, and biology is the study of living
organisms.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="idea">
      <p class="ideaHeading">Any theory of music that claims to be complete must be able to pass the Luxury Yacht Test.</p>
      <p class="explanation">If you succeeded in developing a complete theory of music, you would be
able to use that theory to compose strong original music, which you could
then sell, and use the proceeds to purchase a luxury yacht. Be suspicious
of anyone claiming to completely understand what music is
who does not own a luxury yacht. (And no, I do not own a luxury yacht. It
follows that the theory revealed in my book is not complete. I claim only that it is plausible
and that it explains more about music than anyone else's theories.)</p>
      </div>
      <div class="idea">
      <p class="ideaHeading">The human brain is an information processing system.</p>
      <p class="explanation">An <b>information processing system</b> has four basic components: input, output, calculation and storage.
Applying this framework to the analysis of music, music appears to represent the input.
What kind of information is the output, and what does it mean? How is it calculated?</p>
      </div>
      <div class="idea">
      <p class="ideaHeading">Music is a super-stimulus for the perception of <i>musicality</i> in speech.</p>
      <p class="explanation"><b>Musicality</b> is a perceived attribute of speech, which tells the 
listener important information about the speaker and the speech. Music is a <b>super-stimulus</b> for this perceived musicality, i.e. music is "speech" that has been contrived to have an unnaturally high level of musicality.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="idea">
      <p class="ideaHeading">Each aspect of music is a super-stimulus for a corresponding aspect
of the perception of musicality of speech.</p>
      <p class="explanation">By investigating each aspect of music, we can make an intelligent
guess as to the nature of the cortical map for which the musical aspect is a super-stimulus,
and then we can determine what the response of that same cortical
map would be to speech, and finally we can determine what role the cortical map plays in the
perception of ordinary speech.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="idea">
      <p class="ideaHeading">"Normal" stimuli for specific aspects of speech perception may
lack properties of corresponding musical super-stimuli.</p>
      <p class="explanation">Musical <b>harmony</b> consists of simultaneous pitch values, yet perception
of simultaneous pitch values from multiple melodies has no relevance to speech 
perception (i.e. we almost always only listen to one person speaking at a time).
The normal function of the cortical map that
responds to consonant relationships between different notes occurring at the same time
within harmonies and chords
must be the perception of consonant relationships between pitch values occurring at <i>different</i> times within the <i>same</i> speech melody.</p>
      <p class="explanation">Normal speech <b>melody</b> is not constructed from musical notes
selected from a musical scale. The normal function of the cortical map that responds to discontinuous
musical melodies constructed from musical scales must be the
perception of <i>continuous</i> speech melody.</p>
      <p class="explanation">The <b>rhythm</b> of speech is not as regular and structured as the
rhythms of music. The normal function of the cortical maps that respond to the regular 
rhythms of music must be the perception of <i>irregular</i> speech rhythm.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="idea">
      <p class="ideaHeading">Dance is an aspect of music.</p>
      <p class="explanation">In other words, dance is not just something which accompanies
music, dance actually <i>is</i> music. Music is a super-stimulus for aspects of 
speech perception, but speech perception is not just the perception of sounds: it also
includes perception of the speaker's movements such as facial expressions, body
language and hand gestures. Dance can be identified as the super-stimulus for this
component of speech perception.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="idea">
      <p class="ideaHeading">There are at least five and possibly six symmetries of music.</p>
      <p class="explanation">These are: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Pitch translation invariance</li>
        <li>Time translation invariance</li>
        <li>Time scaling invariance</li>
        <li>Amplitude scaling invariance</li>
        <li>Octave translation invariance</li>
        <li>Pitch reflection invariance</li>
      </ul>
Each of these symmetries represents an invariance of some aspect of the perceived quality
of music under the corresponding set of transformations.</div>
      <div class="idea">
      <p class="ideaHeading">For each symmetry we can ask "Why?" and "How?".</p>
      <p class="explanation">The first four symmetries are <b>functional symmetries</b> in 
that they satisfy a requirement for invariance of perception, i.e. for each symmetry
in this group our perception
of speech should be invariant under the set of transformations that define the symmetry.
For example, perception of speech melody is invariant under pitch translation so that
people with different frequency ranges can speak the same speech melodies, and have those
melodies perceived as being the same.
The last two are <b>implementation symmetries</b> which play an internal role in the perception of
music. (For example see the next item on octave translation invariance.)</p>
      <p class="explanation">In some cases the "how" part of the question has an answer less trivial than one
might assume at first. It turns out that we can identify components of speech perception
from hypotheses about the existence cortical maps that respond to aspects of music,
and these components reflect the need to achieve perception of speech melody invariant
under pitch translation and time scaling.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="idea">
      <p class="ideaHeading">Octave translation invariance is an implementation symmetry
which facilitates the efficient subtraction of pitch values.</p>
      <p class="explanation">Octave translation invariance is the result of splitting
the representation of pitch into a precise value modulo octaves and an imprecise
absolute value. This split enables the more efficient representation and processing of pitch values,
particularly when one pitch value must be "subtracted" from another to calculate
interval size.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="idea">
      <p class="ideaHeading">Our perception of relative pitch must be <i>calibrated</i> somehow.</p>
      <p class="explanation">This explains the importance of <b>consonant intervals</b> in
music perception. Consonant intervals correspond to the intervals between the harmonic
components of voiced sounds in human speech, and they provide a natural standard for
calibrating the comparison of pitch intervals between different pairs of pitch values.
Our accurate ability to calculate and compare pitch intervals 
enables the pitch translation invariant perception of speech melody.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="idea">
      <p class="ideaHeading">Musicality corresponds to the occurrence of <i>constant activity patterns</i>
in cortical maps.</p>
      <p class="explanation">The regularities of time, pitch and repetition in music
cause the cortical maps responding to music to become divided up into active and inactive zones,
where the division remains constant for all or part of a tune.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="idea">
      <p class="ideaHeading">Constant activity patterns in the speaker's brain are echoed by
similar constant activity patterns in the listener's brain.</p>
      <p class="explanation">Occurrence of constant activity patterns in the speaker's
brain represents information about the internal mental state of the speaker. One 
consequence of the perception by the listener of constant activity patterns in the speaker's brain
is a reinforcement of the listener's emotional reaction to what the speaker is saying.
This accounts for the emotional effect of music.</p>
