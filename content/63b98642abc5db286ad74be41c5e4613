<p style="border-bottom: 1px solid grey; padding-bottom: 5px">
Update (08-10-2008): For topics not covered here, I encourage everyone to read the gitosis <strong><a href='http://eagain.net/gitweb/?p=gitosis.git;a=blob;f=README.rst;hb=master'>README</a></strong>, bundled with the distribution.  There is also an <a href='http://eagain.net/gitweb/?p=gitosis.git;a=blob;f=example.conf;hb=master'>example.conf</a> configuration file that illustrates more features than I have covered here.
</p>
<p>
I have been asked more and more these days, "How do I host a Git repository?"  Usually it is assumed that some access control beyond simply read-only is involved (some users have commit rights).  With access control comes issues of security, and that's a whole other bag of cats.  This post is about presenting an answer to this question, without the fuss.
</p>
<p>
The rest of this article will be a tutorial showing you how to host and manage Git repositories with access control, easily and safely.  I use an up and coming tool called <strong><a href='http://eagain.net/gitweb/?p=gitosis.git'>gitosis</a></strong> that my friend <a href='http://eagain.net'>Tv</a> wrote to help make hosting git repos easier and safer.  It manages multiple repositories under one user account, using SSH keys to identify users.  However, users do *not* need shell accounts on the server, instead they will talk to one shared account that does not allow arbitrary commands.  Git itself is used to setup gitosis and manage the Git repos, which pleases the recursion-seeking orthogonal CS-side of my brain.
</p>
<p>
Assumptions: I take my examples from a Ubuntu Linux server.  While I haven't tested other systems, I imagine different Linux distributions, FreeBSD, OS X, etc... would be similar.  Gitosis is written in Python, so you should have a copy of Python installed as well.
</p>
<p>
Enough talk, let's get down and dirty.
</p>
<h2>Install gitosis</h2>
<p>
<strong>gitosis</strong> is a tool for hosting git repositories (I'm repeating myself for those who skim :)
</p>
<p>
The first thing to do is grab a copy of gitosis and install it on your server:
</p>
<p>
<pre><code>cd ~/src
git clone git://eagain.net/gitosis.git</code></pre>
</p>
<p>
Notice that gitosis is extremely light-weight.  The clone takes a mere couple seconds.  Less is more, and I like that a lot.
</p>
<p>
Next, install it like so:
</p>
<p>
<pre><code>cd gitosis
python setup.py install</code></pre>
</p>
<p>
Don't use --prefix unless you like self-inflicted pain.  It is possible to install gitosis in a non-standard location, but it's not nice.  Read the Caveats section at the bottom and then come back here.
</p>
<p>
If you get this error:
</p>
<p>
<pre><code>-bash: python: command not found</code></pre>
</p>
<p>
or
<p>
<pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "setup.py", line 2, in ?
    from setuptools import setup, find_packages
ImportError: No module named setuptools</code></pre>
</p>
<p>
You have to install Python setuptools.  On Debian/Ubuntu systems, it's just:
</p>
<p>
<pre><code>sudo apt-get install python-setuptools</code></pre>
</p>
<p>
For other systems, someone tell me or leave a comment, so I can update this section and improve this tutorial.
</p>
<p>
The next thing to do is to create a user that will own the repositories you want to manage.  This user is usually called <tt>git</tt>, but any name will work, and you can have more than one per system if you really want to. The user does not need a password, but does need a valid shell (otherwise, SSH will refuse to work).
</p>
<p>
<pre><code>sudo adduser \
    --system \
    --shell /bin/sh \
    --gecos 'git version control' \
    --group \
    --disabled-password \
    --home /home/git \
    git</code></pre>
</p>
<p>
You may change the home path to suit your taste.  A successful user creation will look similar to:
</p>
<p>
<pre><code>Adding system user `git'...
Adding new group `git' (211).
Adding new user `git' (211) with group `git'.
Creating home directory `/home/git'.</code></pre>
</p>
<p>
You will need a public SSH key to continue.  If you don't have one, you may generate one on your local computer:
</p>
<p>
<pre><code>ssh-keygen -t rsa</code></pre>
</p>
<p>
The public key will be in $HOME/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.  Copy this file to your server (the one running gitosis).
</p>
<p>
Next we will run a command that will sprinkle some magic into the home directory of the <tt>git</tt> user and put your public SSH key into the list of authorized keys.
</p>
<p>
<pre><code>sudo -H -u git gitosis-init < /tmp/id_rsa.pub</code></pre>
</p>
<p>
id_rsa.pub above is your public SSH key that you copied to the server.  I recommend you put it in /tmp so the git user won't have permission problems when trying to read it.  Success looks like:
</p>
<p>
<pre><code>Initialized empty Git repository in ./
Initialized empty Git repository in ./</code></pre>
</p>
<p>
(Yes, two times)
</p>
<p>
For good measure, let's make sure the post-update hook is set executable.  I've seen it where sometimes it doesn't get set (problem with older setuptools):
</p>
<p>
<pre><code>sudo chmod 755 /home/git/repositories/gitosis-admin.git/hooks/post-update</code></pre>
</p>
<p>
Here some cool magic happens.  Run this on your local machine:
</p>
<p>
<pre><code>git clone git@YOUR_SERVER_HOSTNAME:gitosis-admin.git
cd gitosis-admin</code></pre>
</p>
<p>
You will now have a gitosis.conf file and keydir/ directory:
</p>
<p>
<pre><code>~/dev/gitosis-admin (master) $ ls -l
total 8
-rw-r--r--   1 garry  garry  104 Nov 13 05:43 gitosis.conf
drwxr-xr-x   3 garry  garry  102 Nov 13 05:43 keydir/</code></pre>
</p>
<p>
This repository that you just cloned contains all the files (right now, only 2) needed to create repositories for your projects, add new users, and defined access rights.  Edit the settings as you wish, commit, and push.  Once pushed, gitosis will immediately make your changes take effect on the server.  So we're using Git to host the configuration file and keys that in turn define how our Git hosting behaves.  That's just plain cool.
</p>
<p>
From this point on, you don't need to be on your server.  All configuration takes place locally and you push the changes to your server when you're ready for them to take effect.
</p>
<h2>Creating new repositories</h2>
<p>
This is where the fun starts.  Let's create a new repository to hold our project codenamed FreeMonkey.  
</p>
<p>
Open up gitosis.conf and notice the default configuration:
</p>
<p>
<pre><code>[gitosis]                  

[group gitosis-admin]
writable = gitosis-admin
members = jdoe                     </code></pre>
</p>
<p>
Your "members" line will hold your key filename (without the .pub extension) that is in keydir/.  In my example, it is "jdoe", but for you it'll probably be a combination of your username and hostname.
</p>
<p>
To create a new repo, we just authorize writing to it and push.  To do so, add this to gitosis.conf:
</p>
<p>
<pre><code>[group myteam]
members = jdoe
writable = free_monkey</code></pre>
</p>
<p>
This defines a new group called "myteam", which is an arbitrary string.  "jdoe" is a member of myteam and will have write access to the "free_monkey" repo.
</p>
<p>
Save this addition to gitosis.conf, commit and push it:
</p>
<p>
<pre><code>git commit -a -m "Allow jdoe write access to free_monkey"
git push</code></pre>
</p>
<p>
Now the user "jdoe" has access to write to the repo named "free_monkey", but we still haven't created a repo yet.  What we will do is create a new repo locally, and then push it:
</p>
<p>
<pre><code>mkdir free_monkey
cd free_monkey
git init
git remote add origin git@YOUR_SERVER_HOSTNAME:free_monkey.git

# do some work, git add and commit files

git push origin master:refs/heads/master</code></pre>
</p>
<p>
With the final push, you're off to the races.  The repository "free_monkey" has been created on the server (in /home/git/repositories) and you're ready to start using it like any ol' git repo.
</p>
<h2>Adding users</h2>
<p>
The next natural thing to do is to grant some lucky few commit access to the FreeMonkey project.  This is a simple two step process.
</p>
<p>
First, gather their public SSH keys, which I'll call "alice.pub" and "bob.pub", and drop them into keydir/ of your local gitosis-admin repository.  Second, edit gitosis.conf and add them to the "members" list.
</p>
<p>
<pre><code>cd gitosis-admin
cp ~/alice.pub keydir/
cp ~/bob.pub keydir/
git add keydir/alice.pub keydir/bob.pub</code></pre>
</p>
<p>
Note that the key filename must have a ".pub" extension.
</p>
<p>
gitosis.conf changes:
</p>
<p>
<pre><code> [group myteam]
- members = jdoe
+ members = jdoe alice bob
  writable = free_monkey</code></pre>
</p>
<p>
Commit and push:
</p>
<p>
<pre><code>git commit -a -m "Granted Alice and Bob commit rights to FreeMonkey"
git push</code></pre>
</p>
<p>
That's it.  Alice and Bob can now clone the free_monkey repository like so:
</p>
<p>
<pre><code>git clone git@YOUR_SERVER_HOSTNAME:free_monkey.git</code></pre>
</p>
<p>
Alice and Bob will also have commit rights.
</p>

<h2>Public access</h2>
<p>
If you are running a public project, you will have your users with commit rights, and then you'll have everyone else.  How do we give everyone else read-only access without fiddling w/ SSH keys?
</p>
<p>
We just use git-daemon.  This is independent of gitosis and it comes with git itself.
</p>
<p>
<pre><code>sudo -u git git-daemon --base-path=/home/git/repositories/ --export-all</code></pre>
</p>
<p>
This will make all the repositories you manage with gitosis read-only for the public.  Someone can then clone FreeMonkey like so:
</p>
<p>
<pre><code>git clone git://YOUR_SERVER_HOSTNAME/free_monkey.git</code></pre>
</p>
<p>
To export only some repositories and not others, you need to <tt>touch git-daemon-export-ok</tt> inside the root directory (e.g. /home/git/repositories/free_monkey.git) of each repo that you want public.  Then remove "--export-all" from the git-daemon command above.
</p>

<h2>More tricks</h2>
<p>
gitosis.conf can be set to do some other neat tricks.  Open example.conf in the gitosis source directory (where you originally cloned gitosis way at the top) to see a summary of all options.  You can specify some repos to be read-only (opposite of writable), but yet not public.  A group members list can include another group.  And a few other tricks that I'll leave it to the reader to discover.
</p>

<h2>Caveats</h2>
<p>
If /home/git/.gitosis.conf on your server never seems to get updated to match your local copy (they should match), even though you are making changes and pushing, it could be that your post-update hook isn't executable.  Older versions of setuptools can cause this.  Be sure to fix that:
</p>
<p>
<pre><code>sudo chmod 755 /home/git/repositories/gitosis-admin.git/hooks/post-update</code></pre>
</p>
<p>
If your Python goodies are in a non-standard location, you must additionally edit post-update and put an "export PYTHONPATH=..." line at the top.  Failure to do so will give you a Python stack trace the first time you try to push changes within gitosis-admin.
</p>
<p>
If you want to install gitosis in a non-standard location, I don't recommend it.  It's an edge case that the author hasn't run up against until I bugged him to help me get it working.
</p>
<p>
For the brave, you need to edit whatever file on your system controls the default PATH for a non-login, non-interactive shell.  On Ubuntu this is /etc/environment.  Add the path to gitosis-serve to the PATH line.  Also insert a line for PYTHONPATH and set it to your non-standard Python site-packages directory.  As an example, this is my /etc/environment:
</p>
<p>
<pre><code>PATH="/home/garry/sys/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/bin/X11:/usr/games"
PYTHONPATH=/home/garry/sys/lib/python2.4/site-packages</code></pre>
</p>
<p>
Be sure to logout and log back in after you make these changes.
</p>
<p>
Don't use the gitosis-init line I have above for the standard install, instead use this slightly modified one:
</p>
<p>
<pre><code>sudo -H -u git env PATH=$PATH gitosis-init < /tmp/id_rsa.pub</code></pre>
</p>
<p>
Be sure to also set PYTHONPATH in your post-update hook as described above.
</p>
<p>
The *should* do it.  I am purposefully terse with this non-standard setup as I think not many people will use it.  HIt me up in #git on FreeNode if you need more info (my nick is up_the_irons).
</p>
<p>
<h3>Non-standard SSH port</h3>
<p>
If you run SSH on a non-standard port on your server, don't use the syntax "git@myserver.com:1234:/foo/bar", it won't work.  Putting the port in the URL doesn't seem to make gitosis, or git, (not sure which) happy.  Instead, put this in your ~/.ssh/config file:
<pre><code>Host myserver.com
  Port 1234</code></pre>
</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>
Well, I hope you enjoyed this tutorial and that it makes your Git hosting life easier.  This is public revision 10.  Please let me know if you find mistakes, omissions, an easier way than what I described, etc...
</p>
<p>
Git it on...
</p>
<p>
(yeah, that was bad...)

<p>I had been wondering about how to implement such a system. I&#8217;m using the git-shell on some accounts, but this will make it possible to restrict projects to certain users.</p>

<p>Great writeup.</p>


	<p>I am excited about Gitosis.  Sounds like a great way to host Git repos.  I had issues with installing it though on my Ubuntu 7.04 system though.  I chatted with Tv on <span class="caps">IRC</span> and it appears there may be a problem with Git binaries installed in &#8216;non-standard&#8217; locations.  I think non-standard means it was installed using something other than &#8216;sudo apt-get install git-core&#8217;.  My Git is compiled and installed from source in the /usr/local/bin dir and you&#8217;ll get an error like the one found in this pastie:</p>


	<p>http://git.pastebin.com/f7884e0be</p>


	<p>According to Tv (the author) on <span class="caps">IRC</span>:</p>


	<p>Tv: glenn: it seems your git is installed outside of the normal <span class="caps">PATH</span> for your system
[11:35am] glenn: hmmm&#8230;  ok, its in /usr/local/bin/git
[11:36am] Tv: glenn: that case is a known problem for gitosis, right now; even if you could get through init, you&#8217;ll have trouble later</p>


	<p>Just trying to save some people some time.  Better to wait for a bugfix from Tv if you are in this situation.  His blog is: http://eagain.net/blog</p>


	<p>Cheers.</p>

	<p>Yup, that&#8217;s a known issue.  If you apply the patch in my Caveats section and then make sure your <span class="caps">PATH</span> gets exported (ala /etc/environment, etc&#8230;) correctly, you will be able to get it working.  My git is in /home/garry/sys/bin and gitosis finds it after I applied the patch (which basically just passes <span class="caps">PATH</span> to subprocesses).</p>

<p>Just a quick comment from&#8230;
   &#8220;The public key will be in $HOME/.ssh/id_rsa.pub. Copy this file to your server.&#8221;</p>


	<p>I was a little confused with &#8220;Copy this file to your server.&#8221; 
o were you talking about the git server or some ssh key server
o if the latter, how do you do that</p>


	<p>These answers might make the tutorial a little more clear, even if

	<p>I&#8217;ve made updates tonight since my original post.  I included a small patch as a part of the regular setup.  It helps gitosis find git if you have git installed in a non-standard location (let subprocesses see your modified <span class="caps">PATH</span>).  Also, it fixes a <span class="caps">BIG</span> show stopper git-checkout-index error if you run git 1.5.3 and higher (which I highly recommend) on your server.  No issue was seen with git 1.5.2.x and lower.</p>


	<p>Thanks to Tv and spearce in #git for the help.</p>

<p>It &#8216;appears&#8217; based on the config presented in this article, that you are granting people ssh access to the git user (pubkey auth), while using /bin/sh (possibly aliased to bash) as the default shell.</p>


	<p>This would give any user added as a &#8216;git user&#8217; full shell access to that account.
I am curious why you are not using the git-shell as the shell for that user instead.</p>

	<p>It does not give a full shell, because in ~/.ssh/authorized_keys we use &#8220;command=&#8221;</p>


	<p>This makes <span class="caps">SSH</span> execute only that command, you can&#8217;t get a login shell.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve fixed the caveats mentioned here, if someone in the audience had trouble, please try with the latest version.</p>


	<p>If you install gitosis outside of the usual <span class="caps">PYTHONPATH</span>, you will still need to add the containing directory to it, before running gitosis-init and for the incoming <span class="caps">SSH</span> sessions. This is a bit of a chicken-and-egg problem to try to solve within gitosis, so you should just make sure the environment is correct before gitosis is run. If anyone has a really neat solution for that, please let me know.</p>

	<p>Not sure.  What git version are you using?  I recommend 1.5.3 or higher on both your local box and the server.  Hit me up in #git on FreeNode, we can work through it.  My nick is up_the_irons.  Then you can post your solution back here for others who might be having the same prob.</p>

<p>Just following up on my own post above where I had some issues.  With the latest updates I pulled from gitosis today I was able to finally build, install, and init gitosis on Ubuntu 7.0.4.  I am up and running and thinking that this is a great tool so far.  Definitely fills a nitch.  Thanks Tv and Garry.  I hope all my installation quirks are behind us now.  :-)</p>


	<p>Now I just have to stop associating the name gitosis with &#8216;halitosis&#8217;.  :-)</p>

<p>I am using gitosis now for my projects and trying to get everything working together nicely.  Can you elaborate on how we should best integrate gitweb and git-daemon with gitosis?</p>


	<p>I am using both tools, however I have seen no impact to using the config settings shown in the example.conf file:</p>


	<ol>
	<li>Allow gitweb to show all known repositories. If you want gitweb,
	<ol>
	<li>you need either this or a [repo foo] section for each repository</li>
		<li>you want visible in gitweb.
gitweb = no</li>
	</ol></li>
	</ol>


	<ol>
	<li>Allow git-daemon to publish all known repositories. As with gitweb,</li>
		<li>this can be done globally or per-repository.
daemon = no</li>
	</ol>


	<p>The gitweb.py file also makes reference to using:</p>


	<p>$projects_list = &#8221;/path/to/your/projects.list&#8221;;</p>


	<p>Is it intended that this file would be auto-generated by gitosis?  I have not been able to find it in any of the dirs under /home/git/.</p>


	<p>Lastly, is there a way to have gitweb serve public repositories openly, yet require basic auth for private repositories?  Since both public and private repos are now colocated in the same dir, and differentiated by gitosis and ssh permissions it would be nice to allow gitweb for private repos for those users who have permissions to see them.</p>


	<p>Thanks!</p>

	<p>git-daemon does not necessarily integrate with gitosis, it just runs along side gitosisnand allows read-only public access to the repos you choose.  that said, changes to gitosis since the time of writing this tutorial have made progress in allowing you to control git-daemon and gitweb settings from gitosis.  That&#8217;s very cool, and you&#8217;ll see examples of how to do that in example.conf.  As for projects.list, i&#8217;m not sure what that does.</p>


	<p>To use basic auth on some repos, i think you need to edit the lighttpd.conf for gitweb, there&#8217;s not a way to do that directly in gitosis</p>

<p>Thanks for the writeup.  I&#8217;ve run into a problem when I try to clone the gitosis-admin repository on my local machine.  From what I can tell, it has to do with the git user being a &#8220;system&#8221; user.  When they are a system user, I cannot ssh in.  If it&#8217;s a non-system user, then I can setup an authorized_keys file with a command nearly the same as the git one and the general functionality seems to work.  So, I&#8217;m wondering, is it required that the git user is a &#8220;system&#8221; user, or, is there something in my <span class="caps">SSH</span> daemon configuration that can allow this?  I have the git user allowed explicitly, but that still doesn&#8217;t work, so it seems to revolve around this &#8220;system&#8221; user aspect.</p>

<p>I should note, in regard to the system user issue&#8230;  I&#8217;m on Ubuntu 7.10.  From what I can derive, I don&#8217;t really need the user to be a &#8220;system&#8221; user.  That would add a level of security in that they are not allowed an interactive shell/session, but unless someone hacked past <span class="caps">SSH</span>+public key+command=, it&#8217;s not too big a deal right, or am I missing a more significant security aspect that covers?</p>

<p>ChrisB, the &#8220;system&#8221; aspect of the adduser command makes the user in a certain <span class="caps">UID</span> range and group of &#8220;nogroup&#8221;.  According to the man page, it also makes it so &#8220;logins [are] disabled&#8221;.</p>


	<p>The Ubuntu 6.06 man page also states that logins are disabled, however I had no problems with the git user being a &#8220;system&#8221; user.  I haven&#8217;t tried installing gitosis on 7.10 yet.</p>


	<p>So I&#8217;d say leave off&#8212;system to adduser if it&#8217;s not working for ya.</p>

<p>Is there something different in the way this would work on Windows (as a client).  I&#8217;ve installed gitosis on my FreeBSD 6.x server and am able to run the &#8220;git clone git://server:repositories/gitosis-admin.git&#8221; command.  I have a &#8220;git&#8221; user (for which I wasn&#8217;t able to set up a blank password.  passable unix fu).  The git command asks for the git user password, which I enter correctly.  My conf file shows this for the gitosis-admin group</p>


	<p>[group gitosis-admin]
writable = gitosis-admin
members = matte@laptop</p>


	<p>But the computer I&#8217;m running the command from is member &#8220;matte@pc&#8221;.  My understanding is that gitosis shouldn&#8217;t allow me to write because that member isn&#8217;t specified.  However, I am able to read and write to the &#8220;gitosis-admin&#8221; project.</p>


	<p>Is it because I have a password on the &#8220;git&#8221; user and it authenticates with the password I set?
Is it because windows (stuck with it for now) doesn&#8217;t have a personally identifiable user ssh key?</p>


	<p>Technically I haven&#8217;t seen how to set up a personal ssh key for my account outside of using PuTTY&#8217;s Pagaent program&#8230; which I&#8217;m running.  But it has my matte@pc public key.  Which isn&#8217;t specified in the config file.</p>


	<p>it doesn&#8217;t depend on running the git-daemon does it?  I set that up too but I can&#8217;t open up projects right now, so I disabled it.</p>


	<p>Thanx in advance.  Email me if you&#8217;d like to take this outta the comments.</p>

<p>@lazz: if you are on ubuntu (or any debian flavor), you can enable the backport repositories for apt-get, then run &#8216;apt-get install git-core&#8217; or &#8216;sudo apt-get update &#38;&#38; sudo apt-get upgrade&#8217; and it will update git to 1.5.5.4.</p>

	<p>Excelent post, it helped me lots.
I have two questions.</p>


	<p>1. Can I make a spanish translation of this article to post it in my blog? (I will link back and give credit).
2. After I set up my repository, I pushed a new branch into it. How do I delete a branch from my repo? do I need to just delete the /home/git/repositories/nameofmyrepo.git/refs/heads/nameofbranchtodelete? or what would be the correct way to do it?</p>


	<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Thanks for the post Garry.</p>


	<p>I have successfully got gitosis installed on Ubuntu 8.04 Server (64bit) in a VMWare virtual machine on VMWare Fusion on my Mac (running Leopard). I have followed all the steps exactly but I seem to have an issue with the ssh key.</p>


	<p>Annoyingly, each time I &#8220;git push origin master:refs/heads/master&#8221; I am prompted for the passphrase. The same key has been installed in my normal user&#8217;s /home/jim/.ssh/authorized_keys file on the same Ubuntu Server and works fine for ssh&#8217;ing from the Mac as user jim.  The key seems to have been added correctly to /home/git/.ssh/authorized_keys:</p>


	<ol>
	<li>autogenerated by gitosis, <span class="caps">DO NOT EDIT</span>

	<p>I&#8217;m a n00b when it comes to ssh keys. Any ideas? Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>@Garry, no I have to enter the passphrase when pushing the gitosis-admin too. Do I need to set up ssh-agent to manage the key authentication. I haven&#8217;t needed this when ssh&#8217;ing (perhaps that it stored in the Mac accounts keychain?)</p>

<p>Does anyone know how to make gitweb show the repositories managed with gitosis? All the repos are owned by user &#8216;git&#8217; and group &#8216;git&#8217; and gitosis makes them not readable, writable or executable by default. This is probably the reason why the gitweb.cgi does not list them, no matter if I work with projects.list and &#8220;gitweb=yes&#8221; or not. When I chmod the repo directories manually to executable (chmod o+x repo.git) it works fine. But of course I don&#8217;t want to log in as root and set that manually each time a repo is created&#8230;. Does anyone know a solution? Thanks for your help. &#8212;Martin</p>

<p>Great tutorial! Everything worked as expected, thanks a lot.</p>


	<p>One question though: is it possible to make gitosis work with non-bare repositories?</p>


	<p>I ask because we use Redmine (www.redmine.org) to manage our projects, and although it can work with bare repositories (tracking commits, etc), it won&#8217;t let us &#8220;browse&#8221; the project files (from it&#8217;s web inteface) on a bare repository. Any clues?</p>

<p>@Garry, thanks, I talked to Tv on <span class="caps">IRC</span>, and he basically said the same thing, gitosis currently expects to handle only bare repositories. But he did give me some clues on how to get Redmine to work with bare repos, he thinks it&#8217;s Redmine that&#8217;s doing something wrong. So I&#8217;m trying to approch this from the other end now :)</p>

<p>Thanks for the info,
I have one issue though, I&#8217;ve been able to clone the gitosis-admin without an issue, I can change it and push it back up to the server.</p>


	<p>I also created a new project and tried to upload it, followed all your steps but when I try to &#8220;git push origin master:refs/heads/master&#8221; it requests a password. Now everything else works via <span class="caps">SSH</span> but this, and I don&#8217;t know whats wrong.</p>


	<p>Any one out there can help?</p>

<p>Aloha @Stu,</p>


	<p>I am using Apache/Passenger with Redmine on <span class="caps">OS X 10</span>.5. I am trying to use the repository option in Redmine to display a Git repo. Unfortunately, I can&#8217;t seem to get Apache, Redmine, and Git to play together. I am able to make it work fine when using Webrick, but not Apache/Passenger. I have tried changing permissions on the .git folder to _www, updating the apache2 conf, etc. to no avail.</p>


	<p>Would you (or anyone else) have any advice on how to make it work, since you have it running already?</p>


	<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Hello DrMark</p>


	<p>I have redmine, passenger, git (using gitosis) and apache working together.  I have to run a script to update the repos view, otherwise they play well.
Are you getting any error messages?</p>

	<p>Hi. Thanks for responding.</p>


	<p>First, I enable the Repository within a project in Redmine and point it to the path of the .git folder. I then save that and navigate to the &#8220;Repository&#8221; tab. I see this message:</p>


	<p>&#8220;The entry or revision was not found in the repository.&#8221;</p>


	<p>I know that the path and everything is correct because the exact same settings work when I start script/server instead of using Apache/Passenger. I suspect that it is an Apache path issue or a file permissions issue. Do you have any special apache settings for the .git folder? What permissions are on that file?</p>


	<p>Thanks!</p>


	<p>DrMark</p>

<p>Is it possible to enable only read acess to different repositories for each one. Not the git-damon way, since it exposes the same set of repositories for every one.</p>

	<p>Sorry for the long delay in getting back to you.</p>


	<p>I think it may be repository permissions too.
     This is what got me.  You run script/server w/a user that has a public cert in the gitosis repos, but the apache/passenger user doesn&#8217;t.  Simple solution&#8230;  create a cert for your passenger user. Add it to gitosis server and assign permissions in gitosis.conf.
     I gave my apache user read permissions on the entire direstory and all files / folders within.  I didn&#8217;t do anything special with the any .git configs. 
     I did have to run &#8220;ruby script/runner &#8220;Repository.fetch_changesets&#8221; -e production&#8221; first.</p>


	<p>Hope this helps&#8230;</p>

<p>Hi folks,</p>


	<p>I&#8217;ve setup gitosis very easy and everything in woks very smooth.</p>


	<p>Right now I&#8217;m writing a small bash script to automate the recurring work of creating repositories.</p>


	<p>But my question is how can I remove a repository from gitosis? Can I just delete /home/git/repositories/REPOSITORY.git (and clean the ~/gitosis-admin/gitosis.conf) or there is an other way to remove it?</p>


	<p>Tnx in advance!

<p>If you keep getting asked for your password when executing git-remote commands like this:</p>


	<p>$git remote show origin
Password:</p>


	<p>...then you may need to tweak your ~/.ssh/config file.  This didn&#8217;t happen to me originally (I&#8217;m using <span class="caps">OSX</span> by the way).  But, when I generated a new key pair for use only with git and placed the public key in the gitosis-admin/keydir (removing the original one used when setting up gitosis) then pushed, I started being asked for my password.  Since gitosis updated the git/.ssh/authorized_keys file on the server with the new public key, the old one was no longer listed there.</p>


	<p>The problem is that by default ssh-keygen names your generated keys id_dsa or id_rsa.  OpenSSH scans your ~/.ssh dir looking for either of these when automagically passing your identity during connection negotiation.  Since my local OpenSSH only knew to pass my id_dsa identity and the server only knew of my danlynn identity, the connection negotiation failed back to interactive password authentication.</p>


	<p>To fix this, I modified my ~/.ssh/config file and added the following lines:</p>

<p>Hi,
to install gitosis on a Mac <span class="caps">OS X</span> Leopard Server I used the recent version of Python 2.5.2 of MacPorts and the hashlib:
&gt; port install python25 py25-hashlib
which will be installed into /opt/local/bin, so make sure it is included <span class="caps">PATH</span> before /usr/bin where the original version is.</p>


	<p>To install the setup tools:
&gt; cd /usr/src
&gt; wget http://peak.telecommunity.com/dist/ez_setup.py
&gt; python ez_setup.py</p>


	<p>Source: http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall#installation-instructions</p>


	<p>Then &#8220;python /usr/src/setup.py install&#8221; will work as described above.</p>

	<p>It turned out that this was because I had rolled my own git and installed it at /opt/git/bin.  While this was in my path (and even in /etc/profile), it was not in the path of the git user.

<p>Hello everyone!</p>


	<p>first i have to say this was a great tutorial! thank you very much.</p>


	<p>second, I came to the comments looking for the answer to the &#8220;ERROR:gitosis.serve.main:Repository read access denied&#8221; question. I didn&#8217;t find what I was expecting but reading the opinion of some of you I solved my problem. When i got the problem, i was using a dsa public key, the only thing I did was change it to rsa and it worked =)..</p>


	<p>finally it is working perfectly, but I got one question with git-daemon and I want to try some luck here.</p>


	<p>I get this error: &#8220;fatal: unable to allocate any listen sockets on host (null) port 9418&#8221; when running git-daemon&#8212;base-path=/some/path
I don&#8217;t understand why it tells me null where my host should go =s. anyway, I tried:
git-daemon&#8212;base-path=/some/path&#8212;listen=MY_HOST_NAME
and didn&#8217;t work either&#8230;</p>

<p>Thanks for this tutorial, garry!</p>


	<p>Since you haven&#8217;t mentioned it in this tutorial (I also haven&#8217;t found it in the gitosis documentation), you might want to add that a user can also have multiple <span class="caps">SSH</span> keys for authentication, e.g. one public key from work and one public key from home.</p>


	<p>Just add the respective public keys to &#8220;keydir/&lt;user&gt;.pub&#8221;, i.e. one key per line in the file. For instance, if user &#8220;jsmith&#8221; uses three different <span class="caps">SSH</span> keys to connect via gitosis to a shared git repository, he would have three keys (= three lines)  in &#8220;keydir/jsmith.pub&#8221;.</p>


	<p>Hope this helps,

	<p>then &#8211; make sure that you follow the tutorial&#8230; I was getting this message when I had not added my repo to the gitosis.conf prior to pushing up the repo&#8230; so make sure that you have the group and such in your gitosis.conf prior to doing your `git push origin master`</p>


	<p>I spent a ton of time searching about getting this going &#8230;</p>


	<p>if you&#8217;re getting the os.py error &#8211; check and see if `git-shell` is in the install directory&#8230; /usr/bin or /usr/local/bin &#8230; I needed to do a symlink to `git-shell` from my install directory&#8230; I have git in /opt/git-1.6.0 with a symlink to that as /opt/git &#8230; so as I update git &#8211; I just relink and that&#8217;ll get the `git-shell` updated too.</p>

It looks like they have removed all of the symlinks and are expecting people to switch to &#8220;git shell&#8221; or &#8220;git commit&#8221; instead of git-shell and git-commit. Anyways I am using an older version of gitosis, so it may have already been fixed.</p>

<p>Hello, I recently update my Ubuntu server because of the recent problem with generated <span class="caps">SSH</span> keys.</p>


	<p>After updating the server, I had to re-generate the keys. Then I couldn&#8217;t do a &#8220;git pull&#8221; anymore, I had to delete they old server&#8217;s key from ~/.ssh/known_hosts.
After deleting it, however I cannot pull. Gitosis is asking for a password.</p>


	<p>This might be because in my &#8220;client machine&#8221; the ssh keys were re-generated too.</p>


	<p>The question is:
How do I update the key in the server? I want to put in the server the key from the client machine that is controlling &#8220;gitosis&#8221;. Did that make sense? :)</p>


	<p>Help!</p>

<p>@lobo_tuerto, if you&#8217;ve followed the directions here, you&#8217;ll want to look at this file:</p>


	<pre><code>/home/git/.ssh/authorized_keys</code></pre>


	<p>Put in your new public key in there, being careful to preserve the &#8220;command=...&#8221; stuff.</p>


	<p>Then update your gitosis-admin repo with your new pub key.  Push this.  You should be allowed to push now b/c you changed authorized_keys.  Gitosis will overwrite authorized_keys at this point, but it is OK b/c you put your new pub key into gitosis-admin repo.</p>


	<p>That should do it.  I&#8217;m typing this from memory, so hopefully I got it right. ;)</p>

<p>Does anyone have any further clarification on making &#8220;multiple repositories&#8221; work?  I&#8217;d like to have the layout of my repositories directory organized into sub-repositories, rather that just one giant directory filled with all the &#8217;.git&#8217; directories.  I&#8217;d like to have somethings similar to:</p>


	<p>/git/repositories/$USERNAME/$REPOSITORY, where I&#8217;d have several values for $USERNAME like this:</p>


	<p>/git/repositories/user1/project1.git
/git/repositories/user1/project2.git
/git/repositories/user2/somthingelse.git
/git/repositories/user3/myproject.git</p>

<p>Just a thought. it would be cool to have an &#8220;add&#8221; permission. That way the admin doen&#8217;t need to explicitly add every project when its started.</p>


	<p>Not sure how that works in practice but I think it means that gitosis will have to append to the gitosis.conf file on the server. Then admin will later have to do a pull and can further refine the permissions.</p>

<p>This does not work on Debian Etch with ssh password login disabled.
workaround: add password to git user.
reason: debian locks passwordless accounts
insecure workaround 2: UsePAM = yes in sshd_config &#8211; but you shouldn&#8217;t have <span class="caps">PAM</span> login active.</p>


	<p>Excellent article
worked out of the box the first time I tried (except installation see below).</p>


	<p>But then I secured my system according to:
http://articles.slicehost.com/2007/9/5/debian-etch-setup-page-1</p>


	<p>/etc/ssh/sshd_config:
  UsePAM = no</p>


	<p>If UsePAM is set to yes, it will work even with password authentication disabled, but it is not fully secure.
With UsePAM set to no, it will only work if a password is added to the git(osis) user account.</p>


	<p>The reason is that Debian locks passwordless accounts, but somehow pam_unix circumvents this over ssh hence it will work with UsePAM = yes.</p>


	<p>Debian Etch install procedure:</p>


	<p>$ apt-get install python-setuptools &#38;&#38; apt-get install gitosis
$ sudo passwd gitosis
$ &lt;prompt password for&gt;</p>


	<p>Dependencies on python-setuptools does not work correctly (at least in my version) so it must be installed first as the article also says.
If gitosis is attempted installed first, it must be removed before python tools is installed_</p>


	<p>$ apt-get remove gitosis</p>


	<p>If gitosis-init is called again with a new public key, the old key will remain installed.
Remove content of .ssh and repositories directories in the git user account , then run gitosis-init again.</p>


	<p>Debian installer creates user &#8220;gitosis&#8221; with home directory &#8221;/srv/gitosis&#8221; which is fine, but different from the above article. It is also possible to manually create a &#8220;git&#8221; user according to the above.
In both cases a password must be added on secured systems.</p>


	<p>Apparently the update hook has the correct permissions from install, so this isn&#8217;t necessary to change.</p>


	<p>gitosis is a very nice tool</p>

<p>i&#8217;m wondering if anyone has used gitosis on a linux (ubuntu) server to keep a website application in sync, like one would do using rsync.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;m thinking that just by issuing:</p>


	<p>~/src/website $ git push mysite.com live</p>


	<p>the live branch would be pushed to the gitosis server, and the files in /home/git/repositories/website would be updated, which would also act as the document root for the web server.</p>


	<p>any thoughts?  is this feasible?</p>

<p>Great article Garry&#8230;</p>


	<p>I am having some trouble though, I hope you can help.</p>


	<p>I have followed the instructions to the letter. The server is on Ubuntu 8.04 and the client (local) is Mac <span class="caps">OS X 10</span>.5.5.</p>


	<p>When I issue this command on the local machine: &#8220;git clone git@192.168.111.52:gitosis-admin.git&#8221;, the server returns this: </p>


	<pre><code>Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/&amp;lt;username&gt;/programming/git/gitosis-admin/.git/
git@192.168.111.52's password:</code></pre>


	<p>I suspect this has something to do with the <span class="caps">SSH</span> public key. I did create on on the local machine, copied it to the server, and issued the command &#8220;sudo -H -u git gitosis-init &lt; /tmp/id_rsa.pub&#8221;. This command returned the two &#8220;Initialized&#8221; lines as you show in your article.</p>


	<p>I understand that git is a system user without password, which means that the <span class="caps">SSH</span> key is the only way to authenticate. But apart from that, I can&#8217;t figure out what I&#8217;m doing wrong.</p>


	<p>Any help is much appreciated!</p>

<p>@Peter you have to make sure the &#8220;git&#8221; user has your pub key in its authorized keys file.  If you followed these directions exactly, it <strong>should</strong> be there.  Double check.</p>

<p>I repeated the steps a few time so I doubt I missed anything, although I am far from perfect.</p>


	<p>It finally worked when I created a normal user (I tried this in Fedora and Ubuntu Linux) using the graphical interface. So the only step I &#8220;customised&#8221; was the manual creation of the git user. I followed all further steps exactly as you set them, and I was finally able to get the gitosis-admin file on my local machine.</p>


	<p>I am a newcomer to Linux so I suspect that not creating a system user may have some security implications. I removed all common user privileges to the git user I created, but still I would be very interested in your comments.</p>


	<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Peter, if your /etc/ssh/sshd_config file has &#8220;UsePAM yes&#8221;, then <span class="caps">PAM</span> may have denied you logging in as your &#8220;git&#8221; user because of various reasons.  The most common one I&#8217;ve seen is that the account is &#8220;locked&#8221;.  What makes an account locked is dependent on your <span class="caps">PAM</span> setup.  Changing the password field for the &#8220;git&#8221; user in /etc/shadow from ! to a * has been reported to solve the problem.</p>

<p>I used PuttyGen on Windows to generate my public key (SSH2 <span class="caps">RSA 1024</span>) and save it locally, and then I uploaded it to /tmp/id_rsa.pub using pscp, but then when I ran</p>


	<p>sudo -H -u git gitosis-init &lt; /tmp/id_rsa.pub</p>


	<p>I kept getting errors, eg:</p>


	<p>gitosis.init.InsecureSSHKeyUsername: Username contains not allowed characters: &#8216;<del>&#8212;</del>&#8216;</p>

	<p>or (after I got rid of everything in the file but the key itself):</p>

	<p>I figured that PuttyGen had generated an <span class="caps">SSH2</span> public key file in a slightly different format, and &#8216;git gitosis-init&#8217; wanted a user name at the beginning, so I went here:</p>


	<p>http://www.rfc-archive.org/getrfc.php?rfc=4716</p>


	<p>and saw that I could keep the &#8220;<del>&#8212;BEGIN&#8230;&#8221; and &#8220;</del>&#8212;<span class="caps">END</span>&#8221; parts, and replace the &#8220;comment: ...&#8221; line (generated by PuttyGen) with a line reading:</p>

	<p>I had the same problem &#8211; it was because my machine had a firewall blocking outgoing connections on port 9418, the port that git uses.</p>


	<p>Different machines will have different firewalls set up. In my case (on Debian Etch), I first tried to change iptables &#8211; but there was nothing to do there, as it was already allowing all outgoing connections.</p>


	<p>Turns out my <span class="caps">VPS</span> (virtual private server) hosting provider had an <strong>external</strong> firewall blocking most outgoing connections, and I had to open up port 9418 there, via their web interface.</p>

<p>nice post!
I&#8217;m just wondering how to integrate it with git-svn. The repositories folder doesn&#8217;t have a git repo like the one i have in the desktop. I think it&#8217;s only the .git folder (with objects,refs folders and config file) right?
anyway the basic workflow to git-svn for an existing repository is
Don&#8217;t run git svn init bc you&#8217;ll create a new repo, just add this to your .git/config file:
[svn-remote &#8220;svn&#8221;]
        url = https://svn.richapplabs.com/tech/modcart-dev/trunk/ModCloth
        fetch = :refs/remotes/git-svn
then run
git fetch 
if you want to have only part of the history run:
git fecth -r &lt;revision_number&gt;</p>


	<p>you could check with
git svn info</p>


	<p>instead of svn update you&#8217;ll run:
git svn rebase</p>


	<p>Instead of svn commit you&#8217;ll run
git svn dcommit</p>


	<p>however i don&#8217;t know how to add this to a gitosis server to share a git-svn repo</p>

<p>As far as I managed to gather from the <span class="caps">README</span> file here is the magic:
the linux user (ssh/login) is a single user which created without password.
This user is shared amongst al the repositories you are hosting.</p>


	<p>Since all keys at ~/.ssh/authorized_keys are defined with command=&#8217;gitosis-serve&#8217; option, all the commands are to be enforced to go via gitosis-serve which apply a filter on the commands supplied and act accordingly.</p>

<p>Hi and thanks from also for this excellent guide. I would like to contribute something back by showing a solution to a problem I encountered.</p>


	<p>My problem was that I had a cloned repository of one of my projects running on the same server as gitosis and had cloned it by using the direct path to the gitosis-repo (e.g. /home/git/repositories/my_project.git).</p>


	<p>Whenever I pushed some changes from the cloned repository back to the gitosis-repo, the ownership for the new objects in /home/git/repositories/my_project.git/objects got set to the owner I ran the push command with (in my case root). The result was that pulls and pushes from other cloned repositories (on other developers&#8217; machines) aborted with errors since they couldn&#8217;t write or read from and to the gitosis-repo.</p>


	<p>The solution lay in switching the directive in .git/config from</p>


	<p>[remote &#8220;origin&#8221;]
        url = /home/git/repositories/my_project.git</p>


	<p>to:
[remote &#8220;origin&#8221;]
        url = git@gitosis-server:my_project.git</p>


	<p>and adding the public key for root to gitosis-admin/keydir as well as adding root to the authorized users of the project in gitosis-admin/gitosis.conf and then pushing those changes to the server.</p>


	<p>No more wrong ownerships in /home/git/repositories/my_project.git/objects.</p>

<p>if you are at an end figuring out why you are getting the following error even after making sure the keys are in sync like advised in previous posts:
<span class="caps">ERROR</span>:gitosis.serve.main:Repository read access denied
fatal: The remote end hung up unexpectedly</p>


	<p>make sure (server side)
&lt;git home&gt;/.gitosis.conf is a symlink to &lt;git home&gt;/repositories/gitosis-admin.git/gitosis.conf</p>


	<p>essentially, gitosis-serve refers to &lt;git home&gt;/.gitosis.conf file but the real config file (that gets updated when you push) is in the gitosis-admin repo (as per above).</p>


	<p>I had moved the repos over to a new server and inadvertently caused &lt;git home&gt;/.gitosis.conf to become a copy of the real file an not a symlink thus causing an out of sync issue.  All old repos were  working for months but recently I&#8217;d added new repos to the config and just couldn&#8217;t get it to work till now :)</p>

<p>follow-up.  It looks like gitosis requires a minimum of Python 2.5.  I was able to manually work around the &#8220;subprocess&#8221; requirement (2.4), but I&#8217;m not sure I can do the same with the string.rsplit method (introduced in 2.5).  Since I&#8217;m on a system that has a lot of other software I&#8217;m leary of just upgrading Python (I have 2.3) on speculation.</p>

	<p>After changing to user name &#8220;gitosis&#8221; it looks like this
root@git-repo:/home/gitosis/.ssh# cat authorized_keys 
command=&#8221;gitosis-serve myuser@mylocalbox&#8221;, etc etc&#8230;.</p>


	<p>To fix I created a user gitosis with home dir of /home/gitosis and ran the git-init script again.</p>


	<p>sudo -H -u gitosis gitosis-init &lt; /tmp/id_rsa.pub</p>


	<p>sudo chmod 755 /home/gitosis/repositories/gitosis-admin.git/hooks/post-update</p>


	<p>on local box..
git clone gitosis@YOUR_SERVER_HOSTNAME:gitosis-admin.git</p>

<p>Great tutorial.</p>


	<p>I followed all of the instructions and am able to create repositories and add users from my local clone of gitosis-admin.</p>


	<p>I am also able to cd to a clean area in my /home directory and create a clone of the free_monkey repository I created and pushed to the server from under the gitosis-admin structure.</p>


	<p>What I cannot do is clone the new repository from any other user that I have added to the gitosis.conf file. I have checked that the public keys for the added users are exactly the same on the local machine and in the /home/git/repositories/gitosis-admin.git/gitosis-export/keydir directory on the server. The added users have not been added to the /home/git/.ssh/authorized_keys file (only my admin account is present in this file).</p>


	<p>The error that I am getting is:</p>

<p>Creating new repositories is a bit confusing, because you <strong>must</strong> create and commit something in order to do the first push successfully.</p>


	<p>It&#8217;s pretty easy to simply upload an existing repository, as follows. Add your new repository name such as &#8216;newrepo.git&#8217; to the gitosis-admin.git setups, with <span class="caps">SSH</span> keys as needed, and then run this.</p>


	<pre><code>git status # to make sure you're where you want to be
git remote add gitosis git@YOUR_SERVER_HOSTNAME:newrepo.git
git diff git@YOUR_SERVER_HOSTNAME:newrepo.git/master # to make sure you're not stepping on existing work

<p>I&#8217;m having a problem with accessing the gitosis-hosted repos from a new machine and hope maybe somebody here has an idea:</p>


	<p>- My gitosis-server is running git version 1.6.0.4 on a Debian Etch distro
- Another machine which has no problems accessing the gitosis-server (via ssh) runs git version 1.6.0.5 on Mac OS/X 10.5.6
- The new machine which should also be able to access the gitosis-server via ssh rund git version 1.5.6.4 on a Gentoo Linux distro. But this machine cannot access the gitosis-server via ssh. Wenever I try to &#8216;git pull&#8217; or &#8216;git push&#8217; from that machine I get the error message &#8216;Permission denied, please try again.&#8217;</p>


	<p>Cloning the remote repository from the gitosis-server to the git 1.5.6.4 machine works via the git-protocol but then I have no way to push back changes.
I followed all the steps in adding a new user to gitosis just like on the other remote machine running git 1.6.0.5 but to no avail.</p>


	<p>So my questions:
- Can it be that gitosis has a problem with remote machines running different versions of git?
- Or can anybody see another problem i must have overlooked?</p>


	<p>Thanks in advance</p>

<p>In the section below you say to generate a public key &#8211; do you mean for the <span class="caps">GIT</span> user? or for your own regular named user like &#8216;myusername&#8217;.</p>


	<p>Following your instructions I still get an error when i try to push with: git push origin master:refs/heads/master</p>


	<p>What i get is: error:

	<p>==============================</p>


	<p>You will need a public <span class="caps">SSH</span> key to continue. If you don&#8217;t have one, you may generate one on your local computer:</p>


	<p>ssh-keygen -t rsa</p>


	<p>The public key will be in $HOME/.ssh/id_rsa.pub. Copy this file to your server (the one running gitosis).</p>


	<p>Next we will run a command that will sprinkle some magic into the home directory of the git user and put your public <span class="caps">SSH</span> key into the list of authorized keys.</p>


	<p>sudo -H -u git gitosis-init &lt; /tmp/id_rsa.pub</p>


	<p>id_rsa.pub above is your public <span class="caps">SSH</span> key that you copied to the server. I recommend you put it in /tmp so the git user won&#8217;t have permission problems when trying to read it. Success looks like:</p>

<p>As it turns out, it&#8217;s important that a valid <strong>running</strong> shell is suggested.</p>


	<p>I tried using /bin/false to prevent log-in (though it turns out ~git/.ssh/authorized_keys does more than a good enough job of this), and it resulted in me getting no debug messages, nothin&#8217;! Just &#8220;The remote end hung up unexpectedly&#8221;.</p>

	<p>the one hiccup i had was when i added another computer&#8217;s key, i must have done something out of order.  It complained that &#8220;Repository read access denied&#8221; for my new user.  I checked the config file and everything seemed to check out.</p>


	<p>To solve I reissued: git push origin master:refs/heads/master</p>

<p>wallu, to clone from a repo on localhost, you have to provide a /path/to/repo as the git clone <span class="caps">URL</span>, see
http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-clone.html</p>


	<p>For example:
git clone /home/git/repositories/free_monkey.git/</p>


	<p>Also, make sure that does the cloning (and possible subsequent git operations) has read rights to the repoistory directory. I achieved that with adding the user to the git group.</p>

<p>OK, here&#8217;s a weird problem.  When trying to do the initial push of a new repository, I&#8217;m getting the repository read access denied message.  My <span class="caps">SSH</span> key is OK, and the .gitosis.conf symlink is OK.  What I noticed, though, is that the gitosis.conf on the server is out-of-date; it doesn&#8217;t have the change I pushed creating the new test repository.</p>


	<p>Just to be sure, I went back to my gitosis-admin working copy:  `git commit -a` tells me my working directory is clean, and `git push` tells me everything is up-to-date.  I even deleted and re-created my working copy; the gitosis.conf in my working copy is current, but the gitosis.conf on the server is not.</p>

	<p>I tried the modification suggested to the .bashrc file.  This does not solve the problem.  It seems that the .bashrc file does not get run when we git from the server or ssh from the server.

<p>re: bash: gitosis-serve: command not found</p>


	<p>I solved this problem.  The path set by sshd before running the command in the authorized_key file is /usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/bin:/bin, at least on my <span class="caps">SUSE 11</span>.1 system.  I believe this is based on <span class="caps">PATH</span> set on ssh at compile time.  The .bashrc file in the ~git dir cannot not influence <span class="caps">PATH</span> before sshd runs the command in the authorized_keys file.</p>


	<p>A solution is to set <span class="caps">PATH</span> in ~git/.ssh/environment
&lt;&lt;&lt;
<span class="caps">PATH</span>=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/bin:/bin,
&lt;&lt;&lt;</p>


	<p>(If there is a more portable way to do this? I would appreciate someone pointing it out.  I tried
<span class="caps">PATH</span>=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:$PATH
and it did not work.)</p>


	<p>and set &#8220;PermitUserEnvironment yes&#8221; in /etc/ssh/sshd_config</p>

<p>Garry, I follow the steps for times, but I always stuck in this step</p>

<p>Garry, My environment is on Ubuntu intrepid</p>


	<p>You mentioned this &#8220;you have to make sure the “git” user has your pub key in its authorized keys file&#8221; on previous comment. But I found my public key file used &#8220;myusername@myservername&#8221; instead of &#8220;git&#8221;@myservername.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;ve followed the tutorial and created a user named git for gitosis. And then I execute ssh-keygen -t rsa
on my gitosis server and then put it to /tmp on my gitosis server.</p>


	<p>Then I ran sudo -H -u git gitosis-init &lt; /tmp/id_rsa.pub and it passed.</p>


	<p>Then I change mode 755 for post-update and it passed as well.</p>


	<p>But it always asking for password when I ran &#8220;git@YOUR_SERVER_HOSTNAME:gitosis-admin.git&#8221;</p>


	<p>Check the id_rsa.pub file, it does not generate the &#8220;git@myservername&#8221; for user git. Did this issue caused that I cannot pass &#8220;git@YOUR_SERVER_HOSTNAME:gitosis-admin.git&#8221;??</p>


	<p>If it is, can u please tell me where i miss??</p>

<p>Hello Garry</p>


	<p>I have followed the instructions in the blog and I have successfully completed the initial set up of gitosis and I am able to push the gitosis config back to the git server.  However, when I try to create the test repository I get the message -</p>


	<p><span class="caps">ERROR</span>:gitosis.serve.main:Repository read access denied
fatal: The remote end hung up unexpectedly</p>


	<p>when trying to execute the following command &#8211; </p>


	<pre><code>git push origin master:refs/heads/master</code></pre>


	<p>I have tried to re-installing gitosis a couple of times but I am getting the same error.</p>


	<p>Any ideas</p>

<p>Hi everyone,
I host several repositories with gitosis and had this error:</p>


	<p><span class="caps">ERROR</span>:gitosis.serve.main:Repository read access denied
fatal: The remote end hung up unexpectedly</p>


	<p>Solved it by assigning different groups in gitosis-admin/gitosis.conf, e.g.</p>


	<p>[group firstproject]
writable = firstproject
members = punkrats@Webware-Lab</p>


	<p>[group secondproject]
writable = secondproject
members = punkrats@Webware-Lab</p>


	<p>After commit and push origin master, everything worked as expected.
Cheers.</p>

	<p>I think it might be the permission problem, you can check the owner of your test repo. It should not belong to root.</p>

Step 1:
	<ol>
	<li>sudo -H -u git -s</li>
	</ol>


	<p>Step 2:
$ gitosis-init &lt; /tmp/id_rsa.pub
Initialized empty Git repository in /home/git/repositories/gitosis-admin.git/
Reinitialized existing Git repository in /home/git/repositories/gitosis-admin.git/</p>

<p>I have everything working except for one thing.
I clone the repositories (containing websites) locally using 
&#8221;$ cd /a/www.website1.com/&#8221; 
&#8221;$ git clone /home/git/repositories/website1.git htdocs&#8221; 
but this fails because the /home/git files are obviously owned by user &#8216;git&#8217;, whereas the files in /a/* are all owned by myself. If I use sudo to do the clone operation, it goes works but the files in the cloned repo are owned by root.
What is the best solution to this problem? (and ofcourse I prefer not to have to execute chown -R myself:myself)</p>

<p>Never mind &#8230; ignore previous question. It&#8217;s answered in the gitosis readme (/usr/share/doc/gitosis/README.Debian), and it&#8217;s clear that the &#8216;gitosis&#8217; user is meant to be the repository owner. Instructions should be updated to reflect this.</p>

But the git user should have no password . I try to set a password for git , and it works .</p>

<p>and for the ones who cant connect to the server
edit ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
and remove with the comma at the end:
command=&#8221;gitosis-server user@localhost&#8221;,
this is no good solution but it helps when i tried to enter some other command like git clone or something i get the usage syntax of gitosis-server [OPT] <span class="caps">USER</span> or something, but the man page for gitosis server is really not giving any information&#8230;</p>

<p>Thanks for this. How about tagging a release so I can tell the boss what version of gitoisis I installed? It&#8217;s been a year since the last commit and two years since release/0.2.</p>

<p>as grempe wrote above already&#8212;see &#8220;grempe on November 19, 2007 02:37 PM&#8221;</p>


	<p>I set things up as told here
http://sunoano.name/ws/public_xhtml/scm.html#provide_a_git_repository_to_the_public</p>


	<p>then I also wanted to use &#8220;daemon = yes&#8221; so the file git-daemon-export-ok get&#8217;s autogenerated by gitosis and git-daemon knows it can serve this paritcular repo to anonymous users.</p>


<h2>Bottom Line:</h2>	<p>Setting daemon = yes in the [group foo] stanza in .gitosis.conf does not autogenerate ../foo.git/git-daemon-export-ok and thus foo.git cannot be served in read-only mode to anonymous users.</p>



	<p>How do we solve this issue resp. make it work as expected? Maybe some of us do something wrong? I am using the debian gitosis package.</p>

	<p>no, it&#8217;s not. If you&#8217;re refering to the &#8220;Using git-daemon&#8221; section of the readme you&#8217;ll see it mentions what I said above already but doing so does not trigger the autogeneration of the file git-daemon-export-ok.</p>

<p>Hi folks,</p>


	<p>about the issue with git-daemon-export-ok being automatically created &#8230; you have to use a [repo foo] stanza and not a [group foo] stanza; see here

<p>To those of you having the &#8220;read access denied&#8221; error when trying to do your initial push to the repository:  Make sure you ran the &#8216;chmod&#8217; command in the tutorial.  That was the only thing I skipped, and was having the mentioned problem.  It appears that the config file doesn&#8217;t get updated with your new repository settings if you skip that step.</p>

<p>Just a note to others about permissions on the authorized_keys file; I had to make the following permission changes before gitosis would update this file:</p>


	<p>chmod 755 /home/git
chmod 700 /home/git/.ssh
chmod 644 /home/git/.ssh/authorized_keys</p>


	<p>Prior to these changes git kept asking for a password for users who I had added to the keydir but were not been persisted to authorized_keys. Obviously there are security implications to these changes.</p>

<p>I found a bit simpler way to install gitosis without &#8216;polluting&#8217; the system-wide python. To get it working with virtualenv all is necessary is to replace the two calls in the post-update hook with absolute paths. No mucking about with $PYTHONPATH (evil!!) or /etc/environment.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>


	<p>thanks for the great post.</p>


	<p>As far as I can see, the gitosis operations on the server will run as &#8220;git&#8221; (with the user &#8220;git&#8221;). Is there a way to prevent users (who push code) from doing anything beyond pushing code ?</p>


	<p>If I am right (and I am probably not), the git user is just open to anybody (no password), and has a shell, so anybody can login the box as &#8220;git&#8221; and do whatever he wants.</p>

<p>thanks, very useful post.
Just have to say, there was one trick on our system (Ubuntu 8.04.3 <span class="caps">LTS</span> 64bit, git 1.6.4.4 + git ossi):
we are working on mixed platforms (git/gitosis on linux server and TortoiseGIT client on windows).
On server should be located public keys in format which comes from ssh-keygen utility.
For TortoiseGIT you have to convert private keys from ssh-keygen generated format to tortoise suitable format. Do it with puttygen.exe, load private key (generated with ssh-keygen) and save it (key will be the same, but file format differs). Only after this operation we are able to successfully access repositories. If both keys was generated directly with puttygen.exe &#8211; we didn&#8217;t succeed to connect to repos.</p>

<p>Hi there,</p>


	<p>thanks for this tutorial. I got it working after some pain.</p>


	<p>Can somebody point me to the explanation of what a &#8216;bare&#8217; repository is?</p>


	<p>I&#8217;m trying to setup Redmine to recognize a repository hosted directly or indirectly by gitosis. To this end, I have tried to follow stu&#8217;s instructions. In /home/scm/git/checkout/project I have the locally cloned repository with a &#8217;.git&#8217; directory inside and the project files.</p>


	<p>The directory is world readable, all files are world readable.</p>


	<p>Redmine is running through passenger, which is running with the user &#8216;redmine&#8217; after user-switching.</p>


	<p>When I configure the repository path in Redmine and go to the repository, I still get this message:</p>


	<p>&#8220;The entry or revision was not found in the repository.&#8221;</p>


	<p>Any idea?</p>

<p>I understand that `git push origin master:refs/heads/master&#8217; is specifying the refspec, but is this necessary?  We&#8217;ve been using `git push origin master&#8217; here with no problems, but I&#8217;ve been hesitant in suggesting others use this.  Is there something internal to gitosis that requires the refspec to be explicitly set?</p>

	<p>Everyone will be able to clone all of your public keys, see the configuration for all your repositories, know that you&#8217;re running gitosis. Any of these could be a weak link in the chain. Is it worth worrying about?</p>

<p>Wonderful tutorial.</p>


	<p>I ran into the same error as Liutauras and after a lot of googling to find a cached version of http://sk89q.therisenrealm.com/2009/03/fan-of-git/ I applied the following change that solved it for me:</p>


	<p>in run_hook.py</p>


	<p>20    try:
21        shutil.rmtree(export)
22    except OSError, e:</p>


	<p>becomes</p>


	<p>20    try:
21        current_dir = os.getcwd()
22        shutil.rmtree(export)
23        os.chdir(current_dir)
24    except OSError, e:</p>


	<p>It seems it is a bug either in gitosis or, as sk89q says, in python&#8217;s shutil.rmtree. As I am a total analphabet in python I wouldn&#8217;t know. I thought someone else might benefit from this find</p>

<p>Thanks for the setup guide on gitosis, everything worked. Needed to connect apache basic auth, gitweb and gitosis, wrote up the process here: http://leho.kraav.com/news/2009/10/27/using-apache-authentication-with-gitweb-gitosis-repository-access-control/</p>


	<p>Also a visit to #git informed of enhanced version of gitosis: http://github.com/sitaramc/gitolite</p>

<div class="user-text">
<p>just wanted to let people know about gitolite.  Gitosis hadn&#8217;t seen any updates for more than a year, I needed &#8220;per branch&#8221; permissions, including rewind, so I wrote gitolite.  (In perl, in case it matters; I&#8217;m not much of a python guy).</p>


	<p>Now it has a whole lot of features, not just per branch permissions.  A brief list is in the <span class="caps">README</span> at http://github.com/sitaramc/gitolite/blob/pu/README.mkd and amore detailed list in the &#8220;differences from gitosis&#8221; section of http://github.com/sitaramc/gitolite/blob/pu/doc/3-faq-tips-etc.mkd</p>


	<p>Much of gitolite&#8217;s later evolution was dictated by the constant stream of ssh problems that I saw on #git; it is now designed to be as painless as possible, and to be installed entirely from the <strong>client</strong> side.  The idea is that we front-load the ssh problems&#8212;you first get password-less ssh to your server working (just get a shell) and <strong>then</strong> you install gitolite from your client.</p>


	<p>Leho: I will look at that apache auth thing and see if I can put that in gitolite; right now I&#8217;m working with someone on making it more suitable for debian packaging but as soon as that is done I&#8217;ll try and put this in.</p>

<p>I misunderstood what gitweb auth was in the post above.  Seeing the link http://leho.kraav.com/news/2009/10/27/using-apache-authentication-with-gitweb-gitosis-repository-access-control/ given made me understand better.</p>


	<p>With gitolite this is even easier.  Gitolite parses the config file in what I loosely call a &#8220;compile&#8221; step when you push a new gitolite config, and the result of this compile is a pure perl hash that you can just look in to see who&#8217;s allowed to do what.</p>


	<p>As you can see in http://github.com/sitaramc/gitolite/blob/pu/doc/3-faq-tips-etc.mkd#gitwebauth , the actual access control thus reduces to 1 line; the rest is just scaffolding :)</p>

<p>Hello,
I was following you guide and it works fine :)
Just got a problem when trying to add a new user to the git.
I did as you told, but when the user tries to clone git@mydomain:project.git
it asks for the password of the git user
i think this wasnt supposed to happen right?</p>

	<p>I see that some people also had same error as me. I believe it&#8217;s that gitosis scripts are not installing correctly?</p>

<p>I was getting the error</p>


	<pre><code>ERROR:gitosis.serve.main:Repository read access denied fatal: The remote end hung up unexpectedly</code></pre>


	<p>which was due to my post-update hook not being fired. If this happens, su into your git user, then try to run the hook manually. I got some complaints regarding <span class="caps">GIT</span>_DIR. To fix this, I added</p>


	<pre><code>GIT_DIR=$HOME/repositories/gitosis-admin.git/</code></pre>

<p>Great explanation, thanks!</p>


	<p>A few things I noticed when using gitosis with Karmic Koala (Ubuntu 9.10), and using the gitosis setup that results from running &#8216;apt-get install gitosis&#8217;:
instead of the first line twice, as stated in the post. This may be due to my going through the instructions multiple times (before I figured out the glitch above). I thought I thoroughly cleaned out the old installation when I reinstalled, but I might have missed something.</p>


	<ul>
	<li>Koala doesn&#8217;t have git-daemon (or a link to it) in the path. If you wish to run it, you have to give the full path: /usr/lib/git-core/git-daemon, or establish a link to it somewhere in the path.</li>
	</ul>


	<p>This question probably applies however one gets and installs gitosis:</p>


	<ul>
	<li>git-daemon is just the daemon. Are there scripts available that integrate it into a debian-style /etc/init.d/... scheme for easy management?</li>

<div class="user-text">
<p>To answer my own question about git-daemon and init-scripts &#8230; it seems there is a git-daemon-run in the Ubuntu repository, but it pulls in a whole new runlevel-type infrastructure (that seems to sometimes cause problems on some system) just because one of the developers involved doesn&#8217;t like init scripts.</p>


	<p>So, like the internet, just route around obstacles. Ignore git-daemon-run and head over to http://pastie.org/227647 for an init script that seems to work just fine after some minor and fairly obvious path and account-name tweaking. For some context on doing this, see</p>

<p>Please help: gitosis-init does not seem to add my laptop public key to
the git account on the repository server at all.</p>


	<p>After copying my laptop public key to /tmp on the server, I run the
following command on the server:</p>


	<p>sudo -H -u git gitosis-init &lt; /tmp/id_dsa.pub</p>


	<p>I get the expected</p>


	<p>Reinitialized existing Git repository in /var/gitosis/repositories/
gitosis-admin.git/
Reinitialized existing Git repository in /var/gitosis/repositories/
gitosis-admin.git/</p>


	<p>then I did this:
sudo chmod 755 /var/gitosis/repositories/gitosis-admin.git/hooks/post-
update</p>


	<p>But when I run the following commands on the server to see if my
laptop public key has been added, it&#8217;s not there:
sudo ls /var/gitosis/repositories/gitosis-admin.git/gitosis-export/
keydir
sudo gedit /var/gitosis/.ssh/authorized_keys</p>


	<p>I can ssh to the server from the laptop but when I try to git clone
g&#8230;@server.local:gitosis-admin.git, I get &#8220;Permission denied
(publickey)&#8221;, which makes sense because my laptop public key is not in
gitosis-export/keydir nor gitosis/.ssh/authorized_keys.</p>


	<p>I suspect that gitosis-init has failed to put my laptop public key in
those two places.  What should I do?</p>


	<p>Thanks much.</p>

<p>With regard the post above: I spent almost 6 hours on this and a hero named Ilari on irc://irc.freenode.net/git solved it in 30 seconds.  The key is that gitosis-init works only once.  I wish that the manual had pointed that out.  The hero recommended that I check out Gitolite.  Thank you !</p>

	<pre><code>and reinstalled everything from scratch. I realized I had encountered the error before but had forgotten where it was coming from.

<p>Thanks for this introduction! It was a bit easier for me because Debian Lenny has a gitosis package, though they choose &#8220;gitosis&#8221; as the username and &#8221;/srv/gitosis&#8221; as the home directory. (Just wanted to point that out for others reading this article.)</p>

<p>when I setup and run the git clone, I have this error and i finally solved it:</p>


	<p>git@xx.xx.xx.xx&#8217;s password: 
fatal: &#8216;gitosis-admin.git&#8217; does not appear to be a git repository
fatal: The remote end hung up unexpectedly</p>


	<p>the problem was i used the wrong public key to run gitosis-init the first time.
and after i put the correct one there and run the gitosis-init again. it does not use the new one.
and I checked some where on the web said only the &#8216;initial user&#8217; can connect and create other users.</p>


	<p>So, i remove the /home/git/repositories/gitosis-admin.git folder
and run the gitosis-init again.
then it can clone the git.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m having an issue&#8230; I set up a bare repo on a windows share to sync my emacs config stuff. I have a folder with all my files so that I can work from my desktop or laptop at work and always be covered.</p>


	<p>The problem is:
- dir called &#8216;org&#8217; with all my emacs org-mode stuff, an elisp folder, my .emacs, etc.
- dir inside &#8216;org&#8217; (~/org/elisp/org.git) with the git of org-mode
- have repeatedly done things like &#8216;git add .&#8217; and &#8216;commit -a&#8217; from ~/org and even within ~/org/elisp/org.git
- no matter what I do, when I clone to my other computer, org/elisp/org.git is empty. None of the org-mode elisp files are present as they should. The actual souce is full of files.</p>


	<p>I even just repeated this by creating a brand new bare repo, pushed to it&#8230; no luck!</p>


	<p>Is there an issue with directories? With git repos inside of git repos? With folders name x.y (period in the name)?</p>

<p>Setting this up on a different <span class="caps">OSX</span> box after a successful setup on another machine, I flew thru the tut and skipped the step:
sudo chmod 755 /home/git/repositories/gitosis-admin.git/hooks/post-update</p>


	<p>That was a fail because it turns out it wasn&#8217;t executable by default. Trying to add additional users wouldn&#8217;t work because of that, and I was receiving the dreaded &#8220;ERROR:gitosis.serve.main:Repository read access denied&#8221;.

<p>Is there anyway to make only part of a repo accessible by users.</p>


<h1>For example</h1>	<p>myrepo/project1
myrepo/project2
myrepo/project3</p>



	<p>I want a single repo so branchs can span them all but I only want some users read access to project1 while others have write access to all object while yet others can only see project3.</p>


	<p>I thought it would look like this
[group myteam]
members = jdoe mike
writable = myrepo</p>


	<p>[group myteam-limited1]
members = jack
readonly = myrepo/project1
writable = myrepo/project2 myrepo/project3</p>


	<p>[group myteam-limited2]
members = kim
readonly = myrepo/project3</p>


	<p>I know I can do this with multiple repos&#8217; but then I lose the ability to branch them all as a single unit of software.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Repository read access denied&#8221;</p>


	<p>and in my case the error was thrown because the right key wasn&#8217;t in the ssh-keychain. you can check this with ssh-add -l. if necessary you can add the right key with ssh-add /root/.ssh/&lt;keyfile&gt;.</p>

<p>Thanks for the wonderful write-up. However I have been stuck up at a particular point of the configuration.</p>


	<p>I have done the server installations, creating ssh key for administrator and scp&#8217;ing it to server, cloning the gitosis-admin repo on the client. Here is where I get errors.</p>


	<p>On the client machine (from where I am remotely administering my git server), I edited the gitosis.conf file and added a group and a rep section with my project details.</p>


	<p>Then created my project folder, did the following: 
mkdir my_project
cd my_project
git init
touch somefile.sh anotherfile.sh
git add .
git commit -a
git remote add origin git@&lt;server i&gt;:my_project.git
git push origin master:refs/heads/master</p>


	<p><del>&#8212;output</del>&#8212;
git@172.17.5.216&#8217;s password:   &lt; I enter the server&#8217;s git user&#8217;s password here&gt;  and get this error message&#8212;&gt;
fatal: &#8216;my_project.git&#8217; does not appear to be a git repository
fatal: The remote end hung up unexpectedly</p>


	<p>I have been breaking my head over this for long, and followed all the steps correctly upto this point. Why is the command not able to create the my_project.git repository in my server&#8217;s /home/git/repositories folder?</p>


	<p>Urgent help appreciated!
Thanks,</p>

<p>A warning for others. I am investigating Git to use at my company. I didn&#8217;t want to pollute our current <span class="caps">SCM</span> server, so I used my machine as both the client and server. Epic fail and frustration. Not certain if it is because of client and server on the same box, some configuration cruft from past investigations, or something else. If you are trying gitosis with the same setup and things are not working, give it up and find another machine to use as a server. Once I put the server on a different box, things went smooth.</p>


	<p>One note to make the discussion easier to follow. There are lots of gits floating around: git the <span class="caps">SCM</span> tool, git the user, git the party mix. It would be clearer if the git user was called something else, maybe gituser, user, ...</p>

<p>What I cannot do is clone the new repository from any other user that I have added to the gitosis.conf file. I have checked that the public keys for the added users are exactly the same on the local machine and in the /home/git/repositories/gitosis-admin.git/gitosis-export/keydir directory on the server.

<p>Hi</p>


	<p>I am trying to get gitosis running on my <span class="caps">NAS</span> (Synology) and I am also experiencing the problem with the password when I try to connect. I tried cleaning out everything I could find on the Busybox-Linux, recreated new certificates and so on but all the ideas that were posted here didnt help me.</p>


	<p>Anyway, there is always one point different from the tutorial here: when I run gitosis-init it claims that an existing repository was recreated and I have no idea where this is coming from.</p>


<h2>This is the output</h2><h2>Marvin&gt; sudo -H -u git gitosis-init &lt; /tmp/id_rsa.pub
Initialized empty Git repository in /volume1/homes/git/repositories/gitosis-admin.git/
Reinitialized existing Git repository in /volume1/homes/git/repositories/gitosis-admin.git/</h2>



	<p>Any ideas because I ran out of mine? :-)

<p>Just thought I&#8217;d mention to everyone that the failure &#8220;Permission denied ( publickey).&#8221; can be caused by an incorrect shell for the &#8216;git&#8217; user. You do mention</p>


	<p>I fat-fingered the &#8216;adduser&#8217; command, and the shell ended up being &#8221;/bin/sh/&#8221;. That extra slash at the end was causing some issues. Took a while to figure out ( had to edit /etc/passwd manually ), but once I had it figured out it was a quick fix. You do mention that &#8220;the user does not need a password, but does need a valid shell (otherwise, <span class="caps">SSH</span> will refuse to work)&#8221;, but the error message for getting the shell wrong is a bit misleading.</p>

<p>@Marc This is not an error. It does initialize it twice</p>


	<p><code>Spyder I had a similar problem and the problem was in my ssh keys. When you cloned your gitosis-admin repo, did "git clone git</code>[YOUR_SERVER]:gitosis-admin.git&#8221; work, or did you have to do &#8220;git clone git@[YOUR_SERVER]:~/repositories/gitosis-admin.git&#8221;?
I would suggest starting over from where you create your ssh keys and initialize gitosis. Clean up the authorized_keys file as well.</p>

<p>How is having an account without a password on your server &#8220;secure?&#8221; I don&#8217;t know who started this whole train but having users without passwords is insane. I just test this and with the git account I could roam all over my server. Stupid, plain stupid. I locked it down to a few directories and gave it a password.</p>

<p>I have installed git and gitosis on my gentoo box and seems like everything is working just fine except one.</p>


	<p>I have created repo from desktop and pushed it on server, then I tried to clone it that way:</p>


	<p>git clone git://192.168.1.110:test.git
Initialized empty Git repository in /home/neon/c++/tmp/test/.git/
fatal: Unable to look up  (port 9418) (Name or service not known)</p>


	<p>I as you see something is wrong. I have tried second option</p>


	<p>git clone git@192.168.1.110:test.git
Initialized empty Git repository in /home/neon/c++/tmp/test/.git/
remote: Counting objects: 6, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (2/2), done.
remote: Total 6 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)
Receiving objects: 100% (6/6), done.</p>


	<p>and it worked, so what&#8217;s wrong with git:// ??</p>


	<p>desktop and server are on the same subnet, just connected to same router. It just can&#8217;t be dns issue ?</p>


	<p>This flags on desktop:
emerge -pv git</p>


	<p>These are the packages that would be merged, in order:</p>


	<p>Calculating dependencies&#8230; done!

	<p>And the server:
emerge -pv git gitosis</p>


	<p>These are the packages that would be merged, in order:</p>


	<p>Calculating dependencies&#8230; done!

	<p>I have followed installation from:
http://en.gentoo-wiki.com/wiki/Git
http://en.gentoo-wiki.com/wiki/Gitosis
and this site.</p>


	<p>Any ideas ?

<p>Can anyone comment to the quality consistency of gitosis (maybe someone who has been using it for a year +)?</p>


	<p>The first time I followed this tutorial I ran into the &#8216;read access &#8230;&#8217; horrible error (even tho i certainly 755ed the remotepush) , deleted everything, used bash as the default shell, tried again, and this time got snagged with the remote add origin not actually doing anything  ...</p>


	<p>I tried the remote add origin bit a couple more times, and it finally just worked (I was able to git push). Each time including the success displayed no message.</p>


	<p>I guess I am asking: is this a reliable piece of software? I would be very hesitant using this for a work project&#8230;</p>

<p>Hi,</p>


I am running into problems with the <span class="caps">SSH</span> thing. 
What I did:
Generate ssh key, transfer it to /tmp/id_rsa, run sudo -H -u git gitosis-init &lt; /tmp/id_rsa
It says Initialized existing Git repository in /home/git/repositories/gitosis-admin.git (twice)
But:
In the ~/git/.ssh/authorized_keys, I find this:
	<ol>
	<li>autogenerated by gitosis, <span class="caps">DO NOT EDIT</span>
command=&#8221;gitosis-serve git&#8221;, no-port-forwarding,no-X11-forwarding,.no-agent-forwarding,no-pry Subject: git
And then, nothing. Shouldn&#8217;t there be the public key following?</li>
	</ol>


	<p>What am I missing? Any help appreciated.</p>


	<p>Thanks in advance,</p>

<p>So &#8211; I have to have a total of 3 users at least for this to work correct?

2. Git User (that the gitosis-init was run under)
3. <span class="caps">SSH</span> User (that has allowed ssh access and can edit the gitosis.conf file)</p>

<p>A few things I noticed when using gitosis with Karmic Koala (Ubuntu 9.10), and using the gitosis setup that results from running ‘apt-get install gitosis’: instead of the first line twice, as stated in the post. This may be due to my going through the instructions multiple times (before I figured out the glitch above). I thought I thoroughly cleaned out the old installation when I reinstalled, but I might have missed something.</p>

<p>I fat-fingered the ‘adduser’ command, and the shell ended up being ”/bin/sh/”. That extra slash at the end was causing some issues. Took a while to figure out ( had to edit /etc/passwd manually ), but once I had it figured out it was a quick fix. You do mention that “the user does not need a password, but does need a valid shell (otherwise, <span class="caps">SSH</span> will refuse to work)”, but the error message for getting the shell wrong is a bit misleading.</p>

<p>After updating the server, I had to re-generate the keys. Then I couldn’t do a “git pull” anymore, I had to delete they old server’s key from ~/.ssh/known_hosts. After deleting it, however I cannot pull. Gitosis is asking for a password.</p>

<p>Check the id_rsa.pub file, it does not generate the “git@myservername” for user git. Did this issue caused that I cannot pass “git@YOUR_SERVER_HOSTNAME:gitosis-admin.git”??</p>

<p>I fat-fingered the ‘adduser’ command, and the shell ended up being ”/bin/sh/”. That extra slash at the end was causing some issues. Took a while to figure out ( had to edit /etc/passwd manually ), but once I had it figured out it was a quick fix.</p>

<p>Not sure how that works in practice but I think it means that gitosis will have to append to the gitosis.conf file on the server. Then admin will later have to do a pull and can further refine the permissions.</p>

<p>Peter, if your /etc/ssh/sshd_config file has “UsePAM yes”, then <span class="caps">PAM</span> may have denied you logging in as your “git” user because of various reasons. The most common one I’ve seen is that the account is “locked”. What makes an account locked is dependent on your <span class="caps">PAM</span> setup. Changing the password field for the “git” user in /etc/shadow from ! to a * has been reported to solve the problem.</p>

	<p>I have backed out and followed the instructions step by step, but cannot find my error.
The redhat gitosis  sets up in /var/lib/gitosis and the gitosis-admin.git can ve found in /var/lib/gitosis/repositories</p>


	<p>user gitosis can access the gitosis-admin.git repo and add users fine.
Any thoughts would be welcome.
