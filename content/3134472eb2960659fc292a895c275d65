<p>The following is a summary of considerations and fees incurred when using debit and credit cards in foreign countries . The page is a summary of a thread on Flyertalk.com <a href="http://flyertalk.com/forum/showthread.php?p=4842825" class="external autonumber" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> 
</p><p>Debit and credit cards can be used to withdraw cash from automatic teller machines (ATMs) and to make purchases at stores, restaurants, and hotels where they are accepted. 
</p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=Credit/Debit/ATM_Cards_and_Foreign_Exchange&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2" title="Edit section: Acceptance of debit and credit cards at point of sale">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline" id="Acceptance_of_debit_and_credit_cards_at_point_of_sale">Acceptance of debit and credit cards at point of sale</span></h3>
<p>The acceptance of debit and credit cards varies by country, with acceptance generally being more common in more developed countries, and close to non-existant in non-developed countries. By far, the most accepted cards worldwide are VISA and MasterCard. American Express and Diners Club cards have global networks but acceptance varies widely depending by country and merchant. Most other payment networks such as Diners' Club, Discover, JCB, NYCE, Star, MAC, and Shazam are regional, not global, and are rarely accepted outside of the region they are issued in, and, even then, acceptance is often limited to areas catering to visitors from that region.  
</p><p><br />
</p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=Credit/Debit/ATM_Cards_and_Foreign_Exchange&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3" title="Edit section: Acceptance of debit and credit cards at ATMs">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline" id="Acceptance_of_debit_and_credit_cards_at_ATMs">Acceptance of debit and credit cards at ATMs</span></h3>
<p>Mastercard, VISA, Cirrus, and Plus are accepted at nearly all ATMs worldwide. 
</p><p>Some developing countries either have no ATMs, very limited ATMs, or are not connected to the international networks.  This includes Myanmar in South-East Asia, as well as parts of Africa. In Japan, most bank ATMs don't work with international cards (the cards are even an incompatible size), and you need to look for a post office, 7/11 or Citibank ATM. In certain countries, not every ATM accepts foreign credit or debit cards.
</p><p>Generally, only the main bank account linked to a debit card can be accessed at ATMs outside of your home country; second accounts linked to a card cannot be accessed.
</p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=Credit/Debit/ATM_Cards_and_Foreign_Exchange&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4" title="Edit section: Debit cards compared to credit cards">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline" id="Debit_cards_compared_to_credit_cards">Debit cards compared to credit cards</span></h3>
<p>Debit cards are linked directly to a bank account and immediately deduct the amount of the purchase or withdrawal from the account. Credit cards are cards that are not linked to a bank account, but that instead charge against a credit line, which must be repaid at a later date. If the charges are not repaid before the end of a grace period (usually 0-25 days), interest will be charged. 
</p>
<ul><li> When using an ATM to withdraw cash, it is much more expensive to use a credit card than a debit card. If you withdraw from an ATM using a credit card, you will typically be charged a cash advance fee of ~3% on top of foreign exchange fees (see below). In addition, most card issuers will start charging interest on your cash advance the day you pull money from an ATM (i.e., they won't give you a grace period) unless you have a credit balance on your account. In addition, the interest rate for cash advances is generally much higher than for purchases. In most cases, cash advances are limited to a small portion of your overall credit line.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> When making a point-of-sale purchase, notwithstanding the fees (see below), it is usually better to use a credit card than a debit card, since if your card is stolen you can easily dispute the charges on a credit card and simply switch to using another credit card for the duration of your trip, while a stolen debit card may lead to an overdrawn bank account requiring many additional hassles. Credit card companies will also protect you if you are charged more than you agreed to pay, if you pay for something and never receive it, or if your card is <b>cloned</b> (duplicated) without your knowledge and then used for fraud without being physically stolen.  For this reason some experts do not recommend using debit cards except at ATMs.  
</li></ul>
<ul><li> Credit cards also may include other benefits such as cancellation insurance for flights (usually only in the case of serious sickness), theft or loss insurance for goods (usually only if stolen within 90 days of purchase and a proper police report is filed), collision insurance for rental cars, and emergency health insurance in certain situations while you are travelling.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> ATM-only debit cards (those without the Visa or Mastercard logo) can only be used to withdraw cash at ATMs with a PIN and cannot be used for point-of-sale purchases. Therefore, if stolen, they are somewhat safer than cards with the Visa or Mastercard logo as those cards can be used to make purchases and drain your account balance.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> Credit cards may provide rewards programs that give you free flights or cash back after a certain amount of spending. The cards may be linked to a frequent flyer program.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> If you have an American Express card, in case of a lost or stolen card, you can obtain cash advances and replacement cards easily, by visiting an American Express Office.
</li></ul>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=Credit/Debit/ATM_Cards_and_Foreign_Exchange&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5" title="Edit section: Considerations When Traveling With Debit and Credit Cards">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline" id="Considerations_When_Traveling_With_Debit_and_Credit_Cards"> Considerations When Traveling With Debit and Credit Cards </span></h3>
<ul><li> Travel with one primary debit or credit card as well as a backup card from a different issuer, in case you have trouble with your primary card. Clear your wallet of additional credit or debit cards -- these will only cause you more headaches if your wallet is lost or out of your control.   Also, it is a good idea to carry around only the card you will usually be using and keep the backup cards in a safe location where you are staying, providing further safeguards in case you are robbed or lose your belongings. 
</li></ul>
<ul><li> You may have to get international ATM support specifically activated for your debit or credit card. In addition, some banks will stop your card if they notice sudden transactions in a foreign country. It is best to notify the bank beforehand and get a note added to your account so it does not get passed through their fraud section.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> <b>Be sure you know the PIN</b> for each of your debit and credit cards, in case of an emergency. Many people are not able to access cash using their card because they forget the PIN code. PIN code lengths vary from country to country, but up to six digits are usually accepted anywhere on the Plus/Cirrus networks.  If you have a six-digit PIN and six digits don't seem to work, try entering just the first four numbers of your PIN, or find another ATM.  If the ATM requires 6 digits and you have only 4 digits in your PIN, enter 00 as the last two digits. If your PIN is based "word based" know its numeric equivalent.  Many ATMs outside the USA have no letters to correspond with the numbers. (example: "CASH" = 2274)
</li></ul>
<ul><li> In most countries, you are not responsible for any expenses made on your debit and credit card that occur after you report it lost or stolen.  
</li></ul>
<ul><li> Use of credit and debit cards is not recommended in a few countries due to high potential for fraudulent misuse, e.g. Nigeria. It is recommened that you consult with experts at FlyerTalk and Tripadvisor prior to using cards in certain under-developed countries.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> In case of an emergency, you can use Western Union or MoneyGram to wire yourself some money using your debit or credit card (if you know the numbers). However, exorbitant fees will apply. 
</li></ul>
<ul><li> Many credit cards issued in Western Europe (such as <a href="/wiki/index.php/Credit_Cards_in_France" title="Credit Cards in France">France</a>) as well as Japan feature a <b>chip and PIN</b> system, where credit cards all have a chip built in and you have to type your PIN code into a reader instead of signing a receipt.  All stores that display the Visa, Mastercard, or Amex logos must also accept the sign-and-swipe version of the credit cards; however, some may initially refuse to do so (be persistent, ask for the manager if necessary). With self-service vendors such gas pumps and ticket vending machines, you may be out of luck.
</li></ul>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=Credit/Debit/ATM_Cards_and_Foreign_Exchange&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6" title="Edit section: Additional considerations regarding fees">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline" id="Additional_considerations_regarding_fees"> Additional considerations regarding fees </span></h3>
<p>Transaction fees can be charged by the merchant, the ATM-owner, the bank that issued the card, and through an unfavorable exchange rate. 
</p>
<ul><li> In many cases, the foreign transaction fees are included in the exchange rate, or purchase or withdrawal amount. They are hidden but they are in fact being charged.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> The exchange rate applied to a transaction is usually the rate on the transaction posting date, which can be up to 10 days after the actual transaction date. Therefore, unless currency prices are fixed, it is impossible to know exactly what exchange rate will be charged until the transaction is posted to your account. In general, in addition to the foreign transaction fees, American Express charges an exchange rate that is 0.0% to 0.5% worse than the rate charged by VISA and MasterCard, and Visa and Mastercard charge a rate that is 0.0% to 0.5% worse than the interbank rate quoted on most currency conversion websites. The exchange rate used by Visa on a particular date can be found <a href="http://corporate.visa.com/pd/consumer_services/consumer_ex_rates.jsp" class="external text" rel="nofollow">here</a>.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> If you are staying for a long time in a single country, you may save on fees by opening a local bank account and obtaining a local ATM card. You will usually need a local mailing address and you may need a valid residence permit.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> When making point-of-sale purchases, most US-issued Visa/MC debit cards can only be used in "credit" mode (i.e., swipe-and-sign, as opposed to PIN-based "debit" mode). In addition, if you are faced with a situation where a PIN is required (such as certain unmanned train ticket kiosks in Europe), it is certainly better to use a debit card than a credit card, as PIN-based transactions with a credit card usually incur hefty cash advance fees (in addition to any foreign exchange fees).
</li></ul>
<ul><li> When you are paying by Visa or Mastercard, some merchants will offer to convert your transaction into your home currency  ("'Dynamic Currency Conversion'"). If this offered, you should decline it, as an exorbitant exchange rate of 7% may be charged    <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/travel/2003907603_pucci30.html" class="external autonumber" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. Always check your receipt, and if you see anything involving your home currency in a country that doesn't use that currency, ask the merchant to re-do the transaction in the local currency.  If the merchant insists that the conversion is automatic, it is worth arguing or reporting the incident to your credit card company. Visa "requires the merchant to disclose the fee and must provide the consumer with a choice" of getting the bill in the customer's home currency or the local currency. <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2006/06/25/BUG6DJJFQ5" class="external autonumber" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>
</li></ul>
<ul><li> Foreign currency transaction fees will be charged if the merchant uses a foreign bank, even if the transaction is made in your home currency. For example, when making an online purchase on the US website of British Airways, a US cardholder will be charged a foreign transaction fee even if the purchase is made in US Dollars.
</li></ul>
