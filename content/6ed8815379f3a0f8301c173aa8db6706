          <p>There are mistakes and there are mistakes.</p>
          <p>Some mistakes we learn from. For example: Thinking that selling toys 
            for pets on the Web is a great way to get rich. We're not going to 
            do that again.</p>
          <p>Other mistakes we insist on making over and over. For example, thinking 
            that:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>...the Web, like television, is a way to hold eyeballs still while 
              advertisers spray them with messages. </li>
            <li>...the Net is something that telcos and cable companies should 
              filter, control and otherwise &quot;improve.&quot; </li>
            <li>... it's a bad thing for users to communicate between different 
              kinds of instant messaging systems on the Net. </li>
            <li>...the Net suffers from a lack of regulation to protect industries 
              that feel threatened by it. </li>
          </ul>
          <p>When it comes to the Net, a lot of us&nbsp;suffer from <u>Repetitive 
            Mistake Syndrome</u>. This is especially true for magazine and newspaper 
            publishing, broadcasting, cable television, the record industry, the 
            movie industry, and the telephone industry, to name just six.</p>
          <p>Thanks to the enormous influence of those industries in Washington, 
            Repetitive Mistake Syndrome also afflicts lawmakers, regulators and 
            even the courts. Last year Internet radio, a promising new industry 
            that threatened to give listeners choices far exceeding anything on 
            the increasingly variety-less (and technologically stone-age) AM 
            and FM bands, was shot in its cradle. Guns, ammo and the occasional 
            &quot;Yee-Haw!&quot; were provided by the recording industry and the 
            Digital Millennium Copyright Act, which embodies all the fears felt 
            by Hollywood's alpha dinosaurs when they lobbied the Act through Congress 
            in 1998.</p>
          <p>&quot;The Internet interprets censorship as damage and routes around 
            it,&quot; <a href="http://www.toad.com/gnu/">John Gilmore</a> famously 
            said. And it's true. In the long run, Internet radio will succeed. 
            Instant messaging systems will interoperate. Dumb companies will get 
            smart or die. Stupid laws will be killed or replaced. But then, as 
            John Maynard Keynes also famously said, &quot;In the long run, we're 
            all dead.&quot;</p>
          <p>All we need to do is pay attention to <i>what the Internet really 
            is</i>. It's not hard. The Net isn't rocket science. It isn't even 
            6th grade science fair, when you get right down to it. We can end 
            the tragedy of Repetitive Mistake Syndrome in our lifetimes &mdash; and 
            save a few trillion dollars' worth of dumb decisions &mdash; if we can just 
            remember one simple fact: the Net is a <i>world of ends</i>. You're 
            at one end, and everybody and everything else are at the other ends.</p>
          <p>Sure, that's a feel-good statement about everyone having value on 
            the Net, etc. But it's also the basic rock-solid fact about the Net's 
            technical architecture. And <i>the Internet's value is founded in 
            its technical architecture</i>. </p>
          <p>Fortunately, the true nature of  the Internet isn't hard to understand. 
            In fact, just a fistful of statements stands between Repetitive Mistake 
            Syndrome and Enlightenment...</p>

            phone system knows: Identities, permissions, priorities, etc. The 
            Internet only knows one thing: this bunch of bits needs to move from 
            one end of the Net to another. </p>
          <p>There are technical reasons why stupidity is a good design. Stupid 
            is sturdy. If a router fails, packets route around it, meaning that 
            the Net stays up. Thanks to its stupidity, the Net welcomes new devices 
            and people, so it grows quickly and in all directions. It's also easy 
            for architects to incorporate Net access into all kinds of smart devices 
            &mdash; camcorders, telephones, sprinkler systems &mdash;&nbsp;that live at the 
            Net's ends.</p>
          <p>That's because the most important reason Stupid is Good has less 
            to do with technology and everything to do with value...</p>

            sphere comprised entirely of ends<sup><a href="#FN3">3</a></sup><a name="BFN3"></a>, 
            he's painting a picture that gets at what's most remarkable about 
            the Internet's architecture: Take the value out of the center and 
            you enable an insane flowering of value among the connected end points. 
            Because, of course, when every end is connected, each to each and 
            each to all, the ends aren't endpoints at all. </p>
          <p>And what do we ends do? Anything that can be done by anyone who wants 
            to move bits around.</p>
          <p>Notice the pride in our voice when we say &quot;anything&quot; and &quot;anyone&quot;? 
            That comes directly from the Internet's simple, stupid technical architecture. 
          </p>
          <p>Because the Internet is an agreement, it doesn't belong to any one 
            person or group. Not the incumbent companies that provide the backbone. 
            Not the ISPs that provide our connections. Not the hosting companies 
            that rent us servers. Not the industry associations that believe their 
            existence is threatened by what the rest of us do on the Net. Not 
            any government, no matter how sincerely it believes that it's just 
            trying to keep its people secure and complacent.</p>
          <p>To connect to the Internet is to agree to grow value on its edges. 
            And then something really interesting happens. We are all connected 
            equally. Distance doesn't matter. The obstacles fall away and for 
            the first time the human need to connect can be realized without artificial 
            barriers.</p>

            connects to the Internet. So &quot;can&quot; in the phrase &quot;Everybody

            up kids. It takes a real blockhead with a will of iron to make it 
            worse.</p>
          <p>There are two ways to make it better. First, you can build a service 
            on the edge of the Net that's available to anyone who wants. Make 
            it free, make people pay for it, put out a tin cup, whatever. </p>
          <p>Second, you can do something more important: enable a whole new set 
            of end-of-Net services by coming up with a new agreement. That's how 
            email was created. And newsgroups. And even the Web. The creators 
            of these services didn't simply come up with end-based applications, 
            and they sure didn't tinker with the Internet protocol itself. Instead, 
            they came up with new protocols that use the Internet as it exists, 
            the way the agreement about how to encode images on paper enabled 
            fax machines to use telephone lines without requiring any changes 
            to the phone system itself. </p>
          <p>Remember, though, that if you come up with a new agreement, for it 
            to generate value as quickly as the Internet itself did, it needs 
            to be open, unowned, and for everyone. That's exactly why Instant 
            Messaging has failed to achieve its potential: The leading IM systems 
            of today &mdash; AOL's AIM and ICQ and Microsoft's MSN Messenger &mdash; are private 
            territories that may run <i>on</i> the Net, but they are not part 
            <i>of</i> the Net. When AOL and Microsoft decide they should run their 
            IM systems using a stupid protocol that nobody owns and everybody 
            can use, they will have improved the Net enormously. Until then, they're 
            just being stupid, and not in the good sense.</p>
