<h2>Introduction</h2>

<em>Parsec</em> is an industrial strength, <a href="#bind" >monadic</a> 
parser combinator library for Haskell.
It can parse <em><a href="#bind" >context-sensitive</a>,
<a href="#try" >infinite look-ahead</a></em> grammars but it performs best on <a href="#or" >predictive</a>
(LL[1]) grammars.
Combinator parsing is well known in the literature and offers several advantages
to YACC or event-based parsing. 
<ul>
<li>Combinator parsers are written and used within the same programming language
as the rest of the program. There is no gap between the grammar formalism (Yacc)
and the actual programming language used (C). Users learn just one language!
We can also enjoy all the benefits that exist in the host language:
type checking, module system, development environment, etc.
</li><li>Parsers are first-class values within the language. They can be put into lists,
passed as parameters and returned as values.
It is easy extend the available set of parsers with custom made parsers specific
for a certain problem, see for example <code  ><a href="#many" >many</a></code> or <code  ><a href="#buildExpressionParser" >buildExpressionParser</a></code>.
</li></ul>

Most 
&lsquo;real&rsquo; parsers are built using bottom-up parser generators
like <a href="http://www.haskell.org/happy">happy</a>. This is mostly for reasons
of speed but also because most parser libraries are written for research and inadequate
for practical applications. 
<em>Parsec</em> is designed as a &lsquo;real world&rsquo; library from scratch:

<ul>
<li><em>Speed</em>. Most combinator libraries lack the speed necessary to be competetive with
bottom-up parser generators.
<em>Parsec</em> uses some novel techniques to improve its performance. The library is fast, parsing
thousands of lines a second on today's machines (see the <a href="http://www.cs.uu.nl/people/daan/pbench.html">benchmark</a>
for test results).

</li><li><em>Error reporting</em>. 
<em>Parsec</em> has extensive error messages; giving position, unexpected input, expected productions
and general user messages. The error messages are given in terms of high-level grammar productions
and can be localized for different (natural) languages.

</li><li><em>Libraries</em>. 
<em>Parsec</em> provides a set of basic parsers and provides three
extension libraries, a lexical analysis library, a generalized 
expression parser and a library for parsing permutation phrases.

</li><li><em>Documentation</em>. <em>Parsec</em> is documented with a
reference- and user-guide and example grammar implementations.

</li><li><em>Simplicity</em>. <em>Parsec</em> is designed to be as simple as possible, making it accessable
to both novice and expert users. <em>Parsec</em> is predictive by default, only backtracking
where an explicit <code  ><a href="#try" >try</a></code> is inserted. This makes the operational behaviour
easier to understand than the `normal' approach where backtracking is the default behaviour.
</li></ul>

<h3>About this document</h3>

This document ships in the following formats:
<ul>
<li><em>Postscript (PS)</em>. High quality output, best for printing.
</li><li><em>Acrobat (PDF)</em>. High quality output and hyperlinked. Preferred for online browsing.
</li><li><em>HTML</em>. Poor man's PDF &ndash; hyperlinked but it lacks an index.
</li></ul>

After the introduction, this document contains a simple <a href="#UserGuide" >user guide</a> and a 
than a full <a href="#ReferenceGuide" >reference guide</a> for the library.


<h3>Compatibility</h3>

The core library is written in Haskell98. The extension library <code  ><a href="#ParsecToken" >ParsecToken</a></code> 
uses the <code>forall</code> keyword (to emulate a first-class module) but, to my best knowledge,
this extension is supported by every Haskell98 system. The library is successfully compiled
with GHC 4.x, GHC 5.x, Hugs98 and nhc98, 
but probably works with any Haskell98 compliant compiler or interpreter.

<h4>Compiling with GHC</h4>


<p><em>Parsec</em> is distributed as a package with GHC. This means that you can simply
use the <code>-package text</code> switch to use the <em>Parsec</em> library. Unfortunately, 
Ghc versions up to 5.02 include an old version of <em>Parsec</em>. In this case, you might
want to link with the newest <em>Parsec</em> library. <em>Parsec</em> ships with a makefile that 
creates a Haskell library &ndash; just type <code>make</code> at the command prompt.
</p>
<p>Suppose that the library is compiled in the directory <code>c:\parsec</code>. 
When you compile a Haskell source that uses <em>Parsec</em>, you should tell GHC where
it can find the interface files (<code>*.hi</code>).</p>
<pre  >
ghc -c myfile -ic:\parsec
</pre>
<p>When your linking the files together, you need to tell GHC where it can
find libraries (<code>-L</code>) and to link with the <em>Parsec</em> library too (<code>-l</code>):</p>
<pre  >
ghc -o myprogram myfile1.o myfile2.o -Lc:\parsec -lparsec
</pre>

<h4>Compiling with Hugs</h4>


<p>If you use the <code  ><a href="#ParsecToken" >ParsecToken</a></code> or <code  ><a href="#ParsecPerm" >ParsecPerm</a></code> modules, you need to 
enable the <code>forall</code> extension. Hugs should be started with the <code>-98</code>
option to enable Haskell98 extensions.</p>


<h3>Reporting bugs</h3>

Any bugs (or fixes!) can be reported to the author, Daan Leijen (<a href="mailto:daan@cs.uu.nl">daan@cs.uu.nl</a>).
Any feedback on:
<ul>
 <li>Which parsers are lacking;
 </li><li>Naming of the parsers;
 </li><li>Performance, both time and space.
</li></ul>
is greatly appreciated too.
Besides that, I am also quite interested in any applications, 
especially in a commercial setting, that are created using this library.

<p>The <em>Parsec</em> homepage can be found at: <a href="http://www.cs.uu.nl/~daan/parsec.html">http://www.cs.uu.nl/~daan/parsec.html</a>.
Any useful additions to the library or example grammars will be put
on this www-page. 
If you have written a parser for some language, don't hesitate and
send it to author so it can be put on the www-page too.
</p>
<p>
The library has been tested using the <em>Pbench</em> benchmark. It can
be found at <a href="http://www.cs.uu.nl/people/daan/pbench.html">http://www.cs.uu.nl/people/daan/pbench.html</a>.
</p>

<h3>History</h3>

<ul>
<li>4 Oct 2001: Parsec can now work on any input stream which allows 
one to write a seperate lexer. There is also a user definable state --
for example for creating identifiers from strings. Non-compatible changes:
<ul>
<li><code>brackets</code> is now called <code  ><a href="#angles" >angles</a></code>, while <code>squares</code>
is now called <code  ><a href="#brackets" >brackets</a></code>.
</li><li>The type of many parsers is now more general, ie. <code  ><a href="#GenParser" >GenParser tok st a</a></code>
instead of <code  ><a href="#Parser a" >Parser a</a></code>.
</li><li>The types of <code  ><a href="#type_operator" >Operator</a></code> and <code  ><a href="#OperatorTable" >OperatorTable</a></code> have changed into
a more general type.
</li><li>The <code  ><a href="#ParsecToken" >ParsecToken</a></code> module is now parameterized with a record instead of
an imported module.
</li><li>The <code  ><a href="#token" >token</a></code> parser now parses single tokens.
</li><li>Added new functionality, like <code  ><a href="#sepEndBy" >sepEndBy</a></code>.
</li><li>Added an experimental module for parsing permutations (<code  ><a href="#ParsecPerm" >ParsecPerm</a></code>).
</li></ul>
</li></ul>

<h3>Todo-list</>

The following list of items would be nice to have. Anyone interested in contributing should
send a message to the author. 
<ul>
<li>General symbol parsing. Right now, parser always work on character input. It would be nicer
to generalise this to arbitrary symbols (without sacrificing speed or simplicity!):
<source>
data SymbolParser s a  = ...
type Parser a          = SymbolParser Char a
</source>
</li>
<li>More `real-world' example parsers</>
<li>Error recovery. How this should be done is not exactly clear but it would be nice to add
a combinator that is able to recover from parse errors.
</ul>

<h2 id="UserGuide">Users guide</h2>

All the examples given in this user guide can be found in the
<code>parsec/examples/userguide</code> directory of the parser library. 

<h3>Running a parser</h3>
First of all, import the library into your Haskell module:
<pre  >
module Main where

import Parsec
</pre>

Let's start with a very simple parser. The parser that recognizes
a single letter (a character between <code>'a'</code> and <code>'z'</code>)
is written as:
<pre  >
simple :: <a href="#Parser" >Parser</a> Char
simple  = <a href="#letter" >letter</a>
</pre>

The type of <code>simple</code> shows that <code>simple</code> is a parser that
will return a <code>Char</code> (the parsed letter) whenever it succeeds.
A parser can be executed using
the <code  ><a href="#parse" >parse</a></code>
function. This function takes three arguments:
the parser (<code>simple</code>), the name of the input (<code>&quot;&quot;</code>)
and the input itself. The name of input is only used for error messages
and can be empty in our case. The result of <code  ><a href="#parse" >parse</a></code> is either an 
error (<code>Left</code>) or a succesful result (<code>Right</code>).
We define a simple <code>run</code> function that 
simply prints either the error value or the result value for a specific parser:
<pre  >
run :: Show a =&gt; Parser a -&gt; String -&gt; IO ()
run p input
        = case (<a href="#parse" >parse</a> p &quot;&quot; input) of
            Left err -&gt; do{ putStr &quot;parse error at &quot;
                          ; print err
                          }
            Right x  -&gt; print x
</pre>

<p>(The <code>run</code> function is actually defined in
the <code  ><a href="#Parsec" >Parsec</a></code> module as <code  ><a href="#parseTest" >parseTest</a></code>).
When we load this module into hugs, we can directly and interactively test 
our parsers on different inputs:
<pre  >
Reading file &quot;d:\cvs\parsec\examples\userguide\main.hs&quot;:

Hugs session for:
d:\programs\hugs98\lib\Prelude.hs
d:\programs\hugs98\lib\Maybe.hs
d:\programs\hugs98\lib\List.hs
d:\cvs\parsec\ParsecError.hs
d:\programs\hugs98\lib\Monad.hs
d:\programs\hugs98\lib\Char.hs
d:\cvs\parsec\Parsec.hs
d:\cvs\parsec\examples\userguide\Main.hs
Main&gt; run simple &quot;a&quot;
'a'

Main&gt; run simple &quot;&quot;
parse error at (line 1, column 1):
unexpected end of input
expecting letter

Main&gt; run simple &quot;123&quot;
parse error at (line 1, column 1):
unexpected &quot;1&quot;
expecting letter
</pre>

</p><h3>Sequence and choice</h3>

Two important operations for specifying grammars (and parsers) are sequence and choice.
In our case, parsers can be sequenced using the monadic 
<code>do</code>-notation. For example, the 
following parser parses an open parenthesis followed by a closing parenthesis (<code>&quot;()&quot;</code>):
<pre  >
openClose :: Parser Char
openClose = do{ <a href="#char" >char</a> '('
              ; <a href="#char" >char</a> ')'
              }
</pre>


Two simple parenthesis are not too interesting but in combination with the choice operator
<code>(&lt;|&gt;)</code> we can specify a parser that recognizes matching pairs of
parenthesis. 
Matching parenthesis consist of either an open parenthesis followed by a matching pair
of parenthesis, a closing parenthesis and another matching pair of parenthesis, 
or it is empty; The empty alternative is implemented using the <code>(<a href="#return" >return</a> x)</code>
parser which always succeeds with value <code>x</code> without consuming any input.
<pre  >
parens  :: Parser ()
parens  = do{ <a href="#char" >char</a> '('
            ; parens
            ; <a href="#char" >char</a> ')'
            ; parens
            }
        &lt;|&gt; <a href="#return" >return</a> ()
</pre>


<p>Let's run the <code>parens</code> parser on some input to test its behaviour:
<pre  >
Main&gt; run parens &quot;(())()&quot;
()

Main&gt; run parens &quot;(()()&quot;
parse error at (line 1, column 6):
unexpected end of input
expecting &quot;(&quot; or &quot;)&quot;
</pre>


<a name="Predictive parsers"><h3  >Predictive parsers</h3></a>


</p><p>For reasons of speed,
the <code>(&lt;|&gt;)</code> combinator is <em>predictive</em>; it will only try its second
alternative if the first parser hasn't consumed any input. Consider the following
example parser:
<pre  >
testOr  =   <a href="#string" >string</a> &quot;(a)&quot;
        &lt;|&gt; string &quot;(b)&quot;
</pre>

</p><p>The <code>(<a href="#string" >string</a> s)</code> parser accepts input that equals the
string <code>s</code>. Since both strings in the example start with the same initial
character, the behaviour is probably
not what the user expected:
<pre  >
Main&gt; run testOr &quot;(b)&quot;      
parse error at (line 1, column 2):
unexpected 'b'
expecting 'a'
</pre>

</p><p>Since the first parser has already consumed some input (the <code>'('</code>), the second alternative
is never tried allthough it would succeed! The preferred solution to this problem is to 
<em>left-factor</em>
the grammar by merging common prefixes. The following parser works as expected:
<pre  >
testOr1 = do{ char '('
            ; char 'a' &lt;|&gt; char 'b'
            ; char ')'
            }
</pre>

</p><p>Unfortunately, it is not always possible to left-factor the grammar and in many other cases 
the grammar becomes more complex to understand. 
There is a primitive combinator called <code  ><a href="#try" >try</a></code> that handles these cases in an elegant manner.
The parser <code>(<a href="#try" >try</a> p)</code> behaves just like <code>p</code> except that it pretends that it
hasn't consumed any input whenever <code>p</code> fails. In combination with <code>(&lt;|&gt;)</code> this 
allows for infinite look-ahead in the grammar. Here is the above parser written using <code  ><a href="#try" >try</a></code>:
<pre  >
testOr2 =   try (string &quot;(a)&quot;)
        &lt;|&gt; string &quot;(b)&quot;
</pre>

</p><p>or an even better version:
<pre  >
testOr3 =   do{ try (string &quot;(a&quot;); char ')'; return &quot;(a)&quot; }
        &lt;|&gt; string &quot;(b)&quot;
</pre>

</p><p>Allthough the implementation of <code  ><a href="#try" >try</a></code> is quite efficient there is a penalty when it
fails, ie. it shouldn't be used as an alternative to careful grammar design!
</p>

<a name="Adding semantics"><h3  >Adding semantics</h3></a>

<p>Right now, the <code>parens</code> parser simply recognizes matching pairs of parenthesis
but doesn't return a useful value. We will now extend the <code>parens</code> parser
with `semantic' actions which compute the maximal nesting level of the parenthesis.
The <code>(&lt;-)</code> operator will be used to bind the intermediate values returned
by the parsers. 

</p><p>The <code>nesting</code> parser returns the nesting level of the parenthesis.
The empty alternative returns zero. The other alternative returns the maximal
nesting level of both other parsers:

<pre  >
nesting :: Parser Int
nesting = do{ char '('
            ; n &lt;- nesting
            ; char ')'
            ; m &lt;- nesting
            ; return (max (n+1) m)
            }
        &lt;|&gt; return 0        
</pre>

</p><p>Here is an example session with <code>nesting</code>:

<pre  >
Main&gt; run nesting &quot;(())()&quot;
2

Main&gt; run nesting &quot;(()(()))&quot;
3

Main&gt; run nesting &quot;(()(())&quot;
parse error at (line 1, column 8):
unexpected end of input
expecting &quot;(&quot; or &quot;)&quot;
</pre>

<a name="Sequences and seperators"><h3  >Sequences and seperators</h3></a>

Consider the <code>word</code> parser that parses words: 
a sequence of one or more letters:
<pre  >
word    :: Parser String
word    = do{ c  &lt;- letter
            ; do{ cs &lt;- word
                ; return (c:cs)
                }
              &lt;|&gt; return [c]
            }  
</pre>

</p><p>After parsing at a letter, it is either followed by a word itself or
it returns the single character as a string. Allthough it is not too hard to learn
to recognize these patterns, it is not immediately obvious that a sequence of one or more
letters is parsed by this grammar. Even widely used parser generators like YACC and JavaCC do
not provide any abstraction from these commonly occurring patterns. 
Luckily, we
have the full power of functional programming at our finger tips, it is easy
to provide a custom parser combinator that parses a sequence of one or more
parsers; it is called <code  ><a href="#many1" >many1</a></code>:

<pre  >
word    :: Parser String
word    = many1 letter
</pre>

</p><p>Now it is obvious from the code what <code>word</code> is supposed to do and
it is much easier to specifiy; no strange recursive patterns! 
Beside <code  ><a href="#many1" >many1</a></code>, the library provides the <code  ><a href="#many" >many</a></code> parser
which parses <em>zero</em>
or more occurrences of its argument. The combinators <code  ><a href="#skipMany" >skipMany</a></code> and 
<code  ><a href="#skipMany1" >skipMany1</a></code>
behave like <code  ><a href="#many" >many</a></code> and <code  ><a href="#many1" >many1</a></code> but do not return the values of their argument parser.

</p><p>Another useful pair of combinators are <code  ><a href="#sepBy" >sepBy</a></code> and 
<code  ><a href="#sepBy1" >sepBy1</a></code> which
parse a sequence of parsers separated by some separator. The combinators
<code  ><a href="#sepEndBy" >sepEndBy</a></code> and <code  ><a href="#sepEndBy1" >sepEndBy1</a></code>
parse a sequence of parsers that are either all seperated or terminated by some
seperator (ie. Haskell declarations).

For example, sentences are
a sequence of one or more words separated by one or more spaces or commas and ended 
by a dot, question mark or exclamation mark:
<pre  >
sentence    :: Parser [String]
sentence    = do{ words &lt;- <a href="#sepBy1" >sepBy1</a> word separator
                ; <a href="#oneOf" >oneOf</a> &quot;.?!&quot;
                ; return words
                }
                
separator   :: Parser ()
separator   = <a href="#skipMany1" >skipMany1</a> (<a href="#space" >space</a> &lt;|&gt; char ',')
</pre>

Let's parse some example sentences:
<pre  >
Main&gt; run sentence &quot;hi,di,hi.&quot;
[&quot;hi&quot;,&quot;di&quot;,&quot;hi&quot;]

Main&gt; run sentence &quot;hi,di hi!&quot;
[&quot;hi&quot;,&quot;di&quot;,&quot;hi&quot;]

Main&gt; run sentence &quot;hi,123&quot;
parse error at (line 1, column 4):
unexpected &quot;1&quot;
expecting &quot;,&quot;, space or letter
</pre>

<a name="Improving error messages"><h3  >Improving error messages</h3></a>


</p><p>Allthough the last error message of the previous hugs session is correct, it is not very
user friendly. A better message would simply be <code>&quot;expecting word&quot;</code>.
The error combinator <code  ><a href="#err" >(&lt;?&gt;)</a></code> attaches a high-level error description to 
parsers. Errors can now be given in terms of high-level grammar productions instead of
at the level of characters. We will first attach a description to the <code>word</code> parser:
<pre  >
word    :: Parser String
word    = many1 letter &lt;?&gt; &quot;word&quot;
</pre>

</p><p>Whenever the <code>word</code> parser fails without consuming input, it will now issue an error message
<code>&quot;expecting word&quot;</code>:
<pre  >
Main&gt; run sentence &quot;hi,123&quot;
parse error at (line 1, column 4):
unexpected &quot;1&quot;
expecting &quot;,&quot;, space or word
</pre>

</p><p>It is easy to get rid of the comma and space messages; just use an empty description:
<pre  >
separator   :: Parser ()
separator   = skipMany1 (space &lt;|&gt; char ',' &lt;?&gt; &quot;&quot;)
</pre>

</p><p>Note that the <code  ><a href="#or" >(&lt;|&gt;)</a></code> combinator binds stronger
than the <code  ><a href="#err" >(&lt;?&gt;)</a></code> operator. The error message only reports the expected word now:
<pre  >
Main&gt; run sentence &quot;hi,123&quot;
parse error at (line 1, column 4):
unexpected &quot;1&quot;
expecting word
</pre>


</p><p>Another improvement can be made to the `end of sentence' parser:
<pre  >
sentence    :: Parser [String]
sentence    = do{ words &lt;- sepBy1 word separator
                ; oneOf &quot;.?!&quot; &lt;?&gt; &quot;end of sentence&quot;
                ; return words
                }
</pre>                

</p><p>Let's test the new parser on an uncompleted sentence:
<pre  >
Main&gt; run sentence &quot;hi,di&quot;
parse error at (line 1, column 6):
unexpected end of input
expecting letter or end of sentence
</pre>

</p><p>Allthough the message is again correct, one further improvement can be made. 
The expected letter is a bit confusing; indeed a letter can be added to the last word but
it is probably not what the user intended. Note that the message reports that a letter
can be expected and not a word. This is because a message that is attached to a parser using
<code>(&lt;?&gt;)</code> will only be issued if the parser can not even be started, i.e. when it 
hasn't consumed any input. Since the word parser has already consumed two letters (<code>di</code>)
the expect message for letter is issued.

</p><p>What we want to do is to attach an empty message to the <code>letter</code> parser in <code>word</code>
but maintain the <code>&quot;word&quot;</code> message on the parser as a whole.
<pre  >
word    :: Parser String
word    = many1 (letter &lt;?&gt; &quot;&quot;) &lt;?&gt; &quot;word&quot;
</pre>

</p><p>Finally we have a highly customised error messages which behave quite nicely:
<pre  >
Main&gt; run sentence &quot;hi di&quot;
parse error at (line 1, column 6):
unexpected end of input
expecting end of sentence

Main&gt; run sentence &quot;hi di,&quot;
parse error at (line 1, column 7):
unexpected end of input
expecting word
</pre>

</p><p>After this section, it might seem that error handling is quite involved, but don't be discouraged;
This example grammar was chosen to be tricky and experience shows that for most grammars
just a few error descriptions are necessary.

<a name="Expressions"><h3  >Expressions</h3></a>

</p><p>Expressions are probably one of the most common constructs for which a parser is needed.
Consider the following standard EBNF grammar for expressions:
<pre  >
expr   ::= expr '+' term | term
term   ::= term '*' factor | factor
factor ::= '(' expr ')' | digit+

digit  ::= '0' | '1' | ... | '9'
</pre>

</p><p>The grammar uses different productions to specify
priorities (<code>'*'</code> has higher priority than <code>'+'</code>)
and uses left-recursion to make both star and plus left-associative.

</p><p>Unfortunately, left-recursive grammars can not be specified 
directly in a combinator library. If you accidently write a left
recursive program, the parser will go into an infinite loop!
However, every left-recursive grammar can be rewritten to a non-left-recursive grammar. The library provides combinators
which do this automatically for you (<code  ><a href="#chainl" >chainl</a></code> and <code  ><a href="#chainl1" >chainl1</a></code>).

</p><p>Even when using these combinators to deal with the left-recursion,
it is still a nuisance to code the associativity and priorities of
the operators in such a primitive way. The parser library provides
a standard module <code  ><a href="#ParsecExpr" >ParsecExpr</a></code> to deal more elegantly with 
expression style grammars. Using this library, the above
expression grammar, extended with minus and divide, is specified using
the <code  ><a href="#buildExpressionParser" >buildExpressionParser</a></code> function:

<pre  >
import ParsecExpr

expr    :: Parser Integer
expr    = <a href="#buildExpressionParser" >buildExpressionParser</a> table factor
        &lt;?&gt; &quot;expression&quot;

table   = [[op &quot;*&quot; (*) <a href="#Assoc" >AssocLeft</a>, op &quot;/&quot; div AssocLeft]
          ,[op &quot;+&quot; (+) AssocLeft, op &quot;-&quot; (-) AssocLeft]
          ]          
        where
          op s f assoc
             = <a href="#operator" >Infix</a> (do{ <a href="#string" >string</a> s; return f}) assoc

factor  = do{ char '('
            ; x &lt;- expr
            ; char ')'
            ; return x 
            }
        &lt;|&gt; number
        &lt;?&gt; &quot;simple expression&quot;

number  :: Parser Integer
number  = do{ ds &lt;- many1 <a href="#digit" >digit</a>
            ; return (read ds)
            }
        &lt;?&gt; &quot;number&quot;
</pre>

</p><p>The function <code  ><a href="#buildExpressionParser" >buildExpressionParser</a></code> takes two arguments.
The second argument is the basic expression term and the first a
table of operators of decreasing priority (the higher in the list,
the higher the priority). Operators can be <code  ><a href="#operator" >Infix</a></code>,
<code  ><a href="#operator" >Prefix</a></code> or <code  ><a href="#operator" >Postfix</a></code>.
<code  ><a href="#operator" >Infix</a></code> operators also have an associativity:
<code  ><a href="#Assoc" >AssocLeft</a></code>, <code  ><a href="#Assoc" >AssocRight</a></code> or <code  ><a href="#Assoc" >AssocNone</a></code>.

</p><p>Here is an example session with the <code>expr</code> parser:
<pre  >
Main&gt; run expr &quot;1+2*3&quot;   -- '*' has higher priority
7

Main&gt; run expr &quot;(1+2)*3&quot;
9

Main&gt; run expr &quot;8/4/2&quot;   -- '/' is left associative
1

Main&gt; run expr &quot;8/(4/2)&quot;
4

Main&gt; run expr &quot;1 + 2&quot;  -- wrong! 
1                       

Main&gt; run expr &quot;1+ 2&quot;   -- wrong!
parse error at (line 1, column 3):
unexpected &quot; &quot;
expecting simple expression
</pre>

<a name="Lexical analysis"><h3  >Lexical analysis</h3></a>

</p><p>The previous hugs session with expressions shows that the 
expression parser can not yet
deal with whitespace. Most parsers take their input from a 
lexical analyzer or scanner which filters white space and comments
and returns a list tokens for the parser. How <em>Parsec</em> can work
on such token streams is described in a later <a href="#SeperateScanners" >section</a>. <em>Parsec</em> can also
merge both passes into one parser specification which allows us to
use all the normal parser combinators to deal with lexical analysis too. 
The standard module <code  ><a href="#ParsecToken" >ParsecToken</a></code> deals with issues normally
delegated to a seperate scanner: white space, comments, identifiers,
reserved words, numbers, strings and other tokens. 

</p><p>Unfortunately, most languages disagree on the syntax of comments,
the form of identifiers and for example case sensitivity. The <code  ><a href="#ParsecToken" >ParsecToken</a></code>
module should be parameterized with those differences, but unfortunately, Haskell
doesn't support parameterized modules. The module therefore exports a single
function <code  ><a href="#makeTokenParser" >makeTokenParser</a></code> 
that takes paremeterizable language features as an argument (<code  ><a href="#LanguageDef" >LanguageDef</a></code>)
and returns a (rather large) record that contains a set of lexical parsers.
For your convenience, the module <code  ><a href="#ParsecLanguage" >ParsecLanguage</a></code> contains a set of
common language definitions. For the expression parser, we will use 
haskell-style comments and identifiers</p>

<pre  >
module Main where
import Parsec
import qualified <a href="#ParsecToken" >ParsecToken</a> as P
import ParsecLanguage( haskellStyle )

lexer :: <a href="#TokenParser" >TokenParser</a> ()
lexer  = <a href="#makeTokenParser" >makeTokenParser</a> 
         (<a href="#haskellDef" >haskellDef</a>
         { reservedOpNames = [&quot;*&quot;,&quot;/&quot;,&quot;+&quot;,&quot;-&quot;]
         }
</pre>

<p>For efficiency, we will bind all the used lexical parsers at toplevel.</p>
<pre  >
whiteSpace= P.<a href="#whiteSpace" >whiteSpace</a> lexer
lexeme    = P.lexeme lexer
symbol    = P.<a href="#symbol" >symbol</a> lexer
natural   = P.<a href="#natural" >natural</a> lexer
parens    = P.<a href="#parens" >parens</a> lexer
semi      = P.<a href="#semi" >semi</a> lexer
identifier= P.<a href="#identifier" >identifier</a> lexer
reserved  = P.<a href="#reserved" >reserved</a> lexer
reservedOp= P.<a href="#reservedOp" >reservedOp</a> lexer
</pre>

<p>Every lexical parser from the <code  ><a href="#ParsecToken" >ParsecToken</a></code> module will skip whitespace after
each symbol parsed; parsers which skip trailing whitespace are called <em>lexeme</em> parsers
(the <code  ><a href="#lexeme" >lexeme</a></code> combinator can be used to define them). By skipping trailing whitespace,
it is garanteed that every parser starts at valid input.
For the expression
parser, the lexeme parser <code  ><a href="#reservedOp" >reservedOp</a></code> is used instead of the <code  ><a href="#char" >char</a></code>
and <code  ><a href="#string" >string</a></code> parsers:

<pre  >
import ParsecToken

...

expr    :: Parser Integer
expr    = buildExpressionParser table factor
        &lt;?&gt; &quot;expression&quot;

table   = [[op &quot;*&quot; (*) AssocLeft, op &quot;/&quot; div AssocLeft]
          ,[op &quot;+&quot; (+) AssocLeft, op &quot;-&quot; (-) AssocLeft]
          ]          
        where
          op s f assoc
             = Infix (do{ <a href="#reservedOp" >reservedOp</a> s; return f} &lt;?&gt; &quot;operator&quot;) assoc
</pre>

</p><p>The <code>ParsecToken</code> module also defines a set of high-level combinators like
<code  ><a href="#parens" >parens</a></code> to parse something enclosed in parenthesis 
and <code  ><a href="#natural" >natural</a></code> to 
parse natural numbers in decimal, octal or hexadecimal notation:

<pre  >
factor  =   <a href="#parens" >parens</a> expr
        &lt;|&gt; <a href="#natural" >natural</a>
        &lt;?&gt; &quot;simple expression&quot;
</pre>

</p><p>Finally the <code>run</code> function will be adapted to deal with whitespace. The
main parser needs to skip any whitespace at the start of the input (since all other
parsers only skip trailing whitespace) and needs to end with the 
<code  ><a href="#eof" >eof</a></code>
parser which only succeeds at the end of the input. This parser garantees that all
input will be parsed; if it is left out, a parser is allowed to parse only part of the input.

<pre  >
runLex :: Show a =&gt; Parser a -&gt; String -&gt; IO ()
runLex p input
        = run (do{ <a href="#whiteSpace" >whiteSpace</a>
                 ; x &lt;- p
                 ; <a href="#eof" >eof</a>
                 ; return x
                 }) input
</pre>

</p><p>And that's it. In about 30 lines of code we have a fully functional, extensible expression parser
with comments, priority and associativity rules
and infinite precision numbers in hexadecimal, octal and decimal representation.
<pre  >
Main&gt; runLex expr &quot;1 + 2&quot;
3

Main&gt; runLex expr &quot;1 + {- comment -} 2 * 3 --multiply has higher priority&quot;
7

Main&gt; runLex expr &quot;  0xAA / 0o37 / 2&quot;
2

Main&gt; runLex expr &quot;0xAA / 0o37 2 &quot;
parse error at (line 1, column 13):
unexpected &quot;2&quot;
expecting operator or end of input

<a name="Receipts: Lexeme parsers and Reserved words"><h3  >Receipts: Lexeme parsers and Reserved words</h3></a>

<!--
>
<p>In this section, we will look at the primitive <cref>try</> parser which
is used to parse LL(k) production, i.e. whenever arbitrary look-ahead is needed.
The need for <cref>try</> is illustrated with a simple language for describing
receipts:

--> 

Consider the following EBNF grammar for receipts:

<pre  >
receipt     ::= product* total

produkt     ::= &quot;return&quot; price &quot;;&quot;
              | identifier price &quot;;&quot;          
total       ::= price &quot;total&quot;

price       ::= digit+ &quot;.&quot; digit digit
</pre>

</p><p>A receipt is a sequence of semicolon terminated produkts and ends with the total price of
all products. A produkt is either a name of a produkt with its price or a return produkt in
which case the client receives the specified price. We will construct a parser for receipts
which checks if the total amount is actually correct. 

<a name="Lexeme parsers"><h4  >Lexeme parsers</h4></a>
</p><p>The <code>price</code> parser is a nice exercise in specifying lexeme parsers. The price parser
doesn't allow whitespace inside; For example, we can't use
the <code  ><a href="#decimal" >decimal</a></code> parser to parse the digits in front of the dot since the <code  ><a href="#decimal" >decimal</a></code>
parser would allow whitespace between those digits and the dot. The appropiate solution is
to create a lexeme parser ourselves. 
<pre  >
price   :: Parser Int   -- price in cents         
price   = <a href="#lexeme" >lexeme</a> (do{ ds1 &lt;- many1 digit
                    ; char '.'
                    ; ds2 &lt;- <a href="#count" >count</a> 2 digit
                    ; return (convert 0 (ds1 ++ ds2))            
                    })
          &lt;?&gt; &quot;price&quot;
          where
            convert n []     = n
            convert n (d:ds) = convert (10*n + digitToInt d) ds
</pre>

</p><p>The implementation of the other productions is almost a literal translation of the grammar rules:
<pre  >
receipt :: Parser Bool
receipt = do{ ps &lt;- many produkt
            ; p  &lt;- total
            ; return (sum ps == p)
            }
            
produkt = do{ symbol &quot;return&quot;
            ; p &lt;- price
            ; <a href="#semi" >semi</a>
            ; return (-p)
            }
      &lt;|&gt; do{ identifier
            ; p  &lt;- price
            ; <a href="#semi" >semi</a>
            ; return p
            }
      &lt;?&gt; &quot;produkt&quot;

total   = do{ p &lt;- price
            ; symbol &quot;total&quot;
            ; return p
            }
</pre>

</p><p>Let's try the parser on a few receipts:
<pre  >
Main&gt; runLex receipt &quot;book 12.00; plant 2.55; 14.55 total&quot;
True

Main&gt; runLex receipt &quot;book 12.00; plant 2.55; 12.55 total&quot;
False

Main&gt; runLex receipt &quot;book 12.00; plant 2; 12.55 total&quot;
parse error at (line 1, column 20):
unexpected &quot;;&quot;
expecting digit or &quot;.&quot;

Main&gt; runLex receipt &quot;book 12.00; return 2.00; plant 2.55; 12.55 total&quot;
True
</pre>

<a name="Reserved words"><h4  >Reserved words</h4></a>

</p><p>Unfortunately, the parser will incorrectly return an error on the following
input:
<pre  >
Main&gt; runLex receipt &quot;book 12.00; reader 2.00; plant 1.00; 15.00 total&quot;
parse error at (line 1, column 13):
unexpected &quot;a&quot;
expecting &quot;return&quot;
</pre>

</p><p>What happens here? The <code>produkt</code> parser will try to recognize the keyword <code>return</code>
when it starts scanning <code>&quot;reader&quot;</code>. When the <code>&quot;a&quot;</code> is encountered an
error is returned. The parser will not try the second alternative which starts with an
identifier since the it has already consumed input (i.e. <code>&quot;re&quot;</code>). 

</p><p>This is a good example of a grammar which is hard to left-factor. The use of
the <code  ><a href="#try" >try</a></code> combinator is the appropiate way of solving this problem:
<pre  >
produkt = do{ <a href="#try" >try</a> (symbol &quot;return&quot;)
            ; p &lt;- price
            ; semi
            ; return (-p)
            }
        &lt;|&gt; do{ identifier
            ; p  &lt;- price
            ; semi
            ; return p
            }
        &lt;?&gt; &quot;produkt&quot;
</pre>

</p><p>The test run now gives the expected result:
<pre  >
Main&gt; runLex receipt &quot;book 12.00; reader 2.00; plant 1.00; 15.00 total&quot;
True
</pre>

</p><p>However, we are still not done as the following example shows:
<pre  >
Main&gt; runLex receipt &quot;book 12.00; returns 2.00; plant 1.00; 15.00 total&quot;
parse error at (line 1, column 19):
unexpected &quot;s&quot;
expecting price
</pre>

</p><p>The current parser recognises the keyword <code>return</code> now and it complains
about the letter <code>'s'</code> following it. A keyword however shouldn't be recognised as a keyword
when it is only a prefix of an identifier. The parser <code  ><a href="#notFollowedBy" >notFollowedBy</a></code>
can be used to
make sure that a keyword is not followed by a legal identifier character. Just like checking
that a keyword is not a prefix of an identifier, we should also check that an identifier doesn't
make up a keyword, in order to make the parser independent of the order of choices. 

</p><p>Since adding the <code  ><a href="#try" >try</a></code> combinator in the right places, using <code  ><a href="#notFollowedBy" >notFollowedBy</a></code> and
checking for reserved words is quite subtle, the <code  ><a href="#ParsecToken" >ParsecToken</a></code> module implements all of this
complexity for you; simply add the reserved words to your token definition:
<pre  >
lexer :: <a href="#TokenParser" >TokenParser</a> ()
lexer  = <a href="#makeTokenParser" >makeTokenParser</a> 
         (<a href="#haskellDef" >haskellDef</a>
         { reservedNames   = [&quot;return&quot;,&quot;total&quot;]
         , reservedOpNames = [&quot;*&quot;,&quot;/&quot;,&quot;+&quot;,&quot;-&quot;]
         }
</pre>			

</p><p>Instead of <code>symbol</code>, the combinator <code  ><a href="#reserved" >reserved</a></code> is used to scan reserved words. The <code  ><a href="#try" >try</a></code> combinator is not necessary anymore since the <code  ><a href="#reserved" >reserved</a></code> combinator 
already takes care of it.
<pre  >
receipt :: Parser Bool
receipt = do{ ps &lt;- many produkt
            ; p  &lt;- total
            ; return (sum ps == p)
            }
            
produkt = do{ <a href="#reserved" >reserved</a> &quot;return&quot;
            ; p &lt;- price
            ; semi
            ; return (-p)
            }
      &lt;|&gt; do{ identifier
            ; p  &lt;- price
            ; semi
            ; return p
            }
      &lt;?&gt; &quot;produkt&quot;

total   = do{ p &lt;- price
            ; <a href="#reserved" >reserved</a> &quot;total&quot;
            ; return p
            }
</pre>


</p><p>Finally, everything works as expected:
<pre  >
Main&gt; runLex receipt &quot;book 12.00; returns 2.00; plant 1.00; 15.00 total&quot;
True

Main&gt; runLex receipt &quot;book 12.00; total 2.00; plant 1.00; 15.00 total&quot;
parse error at (line 1, column 13):
unexpected reserved word &quot;total&quot;
expecting produkt or price

Main&gt; runLex receipt &quot;book 12.00; totals 2.00; return 1.00; 13.00 total&quot;
True

<a name="SeperateScanners"><h3  >Advanced: Seperate scanners</h3></a>





</p><p>
In the previous examples we used an integrated approach &ndash; the lexer was specified
using normal parser combinators. This is not always desirable, sometimes there is
already a scanner available or sometimes the input needs pre-processing. Another advantage
of writing a scanner by hand is that the performance of the parser generally improves
about 30% (see the <a href="http://www.cs.uu.nl/people/daan/pbench.html">benchmark</a>
for test results).
</p>

<p>Suppose that we have written a seperate scanner for receipts. The <code>scanner</code>
function returns a list of tokens and a list of error messages.</p>
<pre  >
type Token  = (SourcePos,Tok)
data Tok    = Identifier String
            | Reserved   String
            | Symbol     String
            | Price      Int
            deriving Show

scanner :: [Char] -&gt; ([Token],[String])
</pre>

<p>The parsers should now work on these token streams instead of the normal chararacter
streams. This is reflected in the type. The type of <em>general</em> parsers is
<code><a href="#GenParser" >GenParser</a> tok st a</code>, where <code>tok</code> is the type of the tokens,
<code>st</code> the type of the local user state and <code>a</code> is the type of the result.
Indeed, <code  ><a href="#Parser" >Parser</a></code> is just a type synonym for parsers that work on characters and
have no state:</p>
<pre  >
type Parser a   = GenParser Char () a
</pre>

<p>The <code  ><a href="#token" >token</a></code> parser is used to define a parser that scans a single token. 
The function takes three arguments: a function to show tokens, a function to extract
the source position of a token and finally a test function that determines if the
token is accepted or not. The first two arguments are the same for all our tokens so
we define a little abstraction:
</p>
<pre  >
type MyParser a   = <a href="#GenParser" >GenParser</a> Token () a

mytoken :: (Tok -&gt; Maybe a) -&gt; MyParser a

    showToken (pos,tok)   = show tok
    posToken  (pos,tok)   = pos
    testToken (pos,tok)   = test tok
</pre>

<p>Now, it is easy to define the basic parser that work on tokens.</p>
<pre  >
identifier :: MyParser String
identifier 
  = mytoken (\tok -&gt; case tok of 
                       Identifier name -&gt; Just name
                       other           -&gt; Nothing)

reserved :: String -&gt; MyParser ()
reserved name
  = mytoken (\tok -&gt; case tok of
                       Reserved s   | s == name  -&gt; Just ()
                       other        -&gt; Nothing)

...
</pre>

<p>For an extended example, you might want to look at the implementation
of the <code  ><a href="#ParsecChar" >ParsecChar</a></code> module.</p>

<a name="Advanced: User state"><h3  >Advanced: User state</h3></a>



<p>Since <em>Parsec</em> is already a <a href="#bind" >state monad</a>, it is easy to 
include a user definable state. This state is very useful when building a
symbol table &ndash; strings can immediately be converted to identifiers 
<strong>[footnote: </strong><em>I have to warn the reader though that experience with the HaskellLight compiler
has shown that it hardly pays off in practice to use special identifier
representations instead of normal strings</em><strong>]</strong>. </p>

<p><em>Parsec</em> provides three combinators to handle state. The function
<code  ><a href="#getState" >getState</a></code> gets the state, <code><a href="#setState" >setState</a> st</code>  sets the state to <code>st</code>,
and <code><a href="#updateState" >updateState</a> f</code> updates the state by applying function <code>f</code> to it.
As an example, we show how we 
can count the number of identifiers in a parser.
</p>
<pre  >
run input 
  = case <a href="#runParser" >runParser</a> parser 0 &quot;&quot; input of
      Right n  -&gt; putStrLn (&quot;counted &quot; ++ show n ++ &quot; identifiers!&quot;)
      Left err -&gt; do{ putStr &quot;parse error at &quot;
                    ; print err
                    }

parser :: <a href="#CharParser" >CharParser</a> Int Int
parser 
  = do{ ...
      ; n &lt;- <a href="#getState" >getState</a>
      ; return n
      }

...

myIdentifier :: <a href="#CharParser" >CharParser</a> Int String
myIdentifier
  = do{ x &lt;- identifier
      ; <a href="#updateState" >updateState</a> (+1)
      ; return x
      }
</pre>

<a name="Advanced: Permutation phrases"><h3  >Advanced: Permutation phrases</h3></a>

A permutation phrase is sequence of elements of possibly different types
in which each element occurs at most once and the order is irrelevant. <em>Parsec</em>
provides the module <code  ><a href="#ParsecPerm" >ParsecPerm</a></code> to parse such free-order constructs.
Possible applications include parsers for XML attributes and Haskell style 
records.
<p>Since each element can be of a different type, it is hard to find a typable
approach and we have to resort to judicious use of permutation parser combinators.
Parsers are combined into a permutation parser with the
<a href="#permor" ><code>(&lt;||&gt;)</code></a> operator. At the end, all the elements are
combined using a combination function <code>f</code> that is applied 
using the <a href="#permap" ><code>(&lt;$$&gt;)</code></a> combinator. The whole
permutation parser is than converted into a normal parser using the <code  ><a href="#permute" >permute</a></code>
function. Suppose we want to parse a permutation of
the characters <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, and <code>c</code>. We can write this
as:</p>
<pre  >
perm0 = <a href="#permute" >permute</a> (f <a href="#permap" ><code>(&lt;$$&gt;)</code></a> char 'a'
                   <a href="#permor" ><code>(&lt;||&gt;)</code></a> char 'b'
                   <a href="#permor" ><code>(&lt;||&gt;)</code></a> char 'c')
      where
        f a b c  = [a,b,c]
</pre>

<p>Let's try the parser against some real input!</p>

<pre  >
Main&gt; run perm0 &quot;abc&quot;
&quot;abc&quot;

Main&gt; run perm0 &quot;cba&quot;
&quot;abc&quot;

Main&gt; run perm0 &quot;b&quot;
parse error at (line 1, column 2):
unexpected end of input
expecting &quot;c&quot; or &quot;a&quot;
</pre>

<p>There is an implicit restriction that the parsers in a permutation should
never succeed on empty input &ndash; ie. you can't use <code>(<a href="#many" >many</a> (char 'a'))</code>
to parse an optional string of <code>'a'</code> characters. If there are optional
elements in the permutation, you need to use the special <a href="#permoropt" ><code>(&lt;|?&gt;)</code></a>
operator that takes both a parser and a default value. If the first parser can
be optional, you can use the <a href="#permapopt" ><code>(&lt;$?&gt;)</code></a> operator.
For example, suppose we parse a permutation of: an optional string of <code>a</code>'s, the character <code>b</code> and an optional <code>c</code>.
This can be described by:
<pre  >
perm1 :: <a href="#Parser" >Parser</a> (String,Char,Char)
perm1 = <a href="#permute" >permute</a> (tuple <a href="#permapopt" >&lt;$?&gt;</a> (&quot;&quot;,many1 (char 'a'))
                       <a href="#permor" >&lt;||&gt;</a> char 'b' 
                       <a href="#permoropt" >&lt;|?&gt;</a> ('_',char 'c'))
      where
        tuple a b c  = (a,b,c)
</pre>

</p><p>At the command prompt we can see how
error correction works with permutations.</p>

<pre  >
Main&gt; run perm1 &quot;caaaaab&quot;
(&quot;aaaaa&quot;,'b','c')

Main&gt; run perm1 &quot;cb&quot;
(&quot;&quot;,'b','c')

Main&gt; run perm1 &quot;b&quot;
(&quot;&quot;,'b','_')

Main&gt; run perm1 &quot;&quot;
parse error at (line 1, column 1):
unexpected end of input
expecting &quot;c&quot;, &quot;b&quot; or &quot;a&quot;

Main&gt; run perm1 &quot;c&quot;
parse error at (line 1, column 2):
unexpected end of input
expecting &quot;b&quot; or &quot;a&quot;

The parser <code>(p &gt;&gt;= f)</code> first applies parser

<p>The <code>do</code>-notation of Haskell is syntactic sugar that automatically uses this combinator. 
Using this notation, we can write <code>do{ x &lt;- p; q }</code> instead of the more cumbersome
<code>(p &gt;&gt;= (\x -&gt; q))</code>. The <code>do</code>-notation has a natural operational reading:
first apply parser <code>p</code>, binding its result to value <code>x</code>, and than apply the parser

<p>This combinator is used whenever arbitrary look ahead is needed. Since it pretends

try its second alternative even when the first parser failed while consuming input.

<!--
>
<p>Most programming language grammars need arbitrary look ahead in certain cases.
Since there is no distinction between a lexical and parser phase,
this problem occurs even more often with our parsing combinators.
Whenever such case arises, the <code>try</> combinator is used.
Fortunately, those cases do not arise very often and are most of the time easy to spot.
They occur at parsers that would normally constitute lexical tokens in a traditional parser, 
and are sometimes seen at certain language constructs (like the type contexts in haskell or declarations in C).

-->
</p><p>
The <code>try</code> combinator can for example be used to distinguish
identifiers and reserved words. Both reserved words and identifiers are a sequence
of letters. Whenever we expect a certain reserved word where we can also expect an identifier
we have to use the <code>try</code> combinator. Suppose we write:
</p>
<p><code  >expr&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=&nbsp;letExpr&nbsp;&lt;|&gt;&nbsp;identifier&nbsp;&lt;?&gt;&nbsp;&quot;expression&quot;<br>
<br>
letExpr&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=&nbsp;do{&nbsp;<a href="#string" >string</a>&nbsp;&quot;let&quot;;&nbsp;...&nbsp;}<br>
identifier&nbsp;&nbsp;=&nbsp;<a href="#many1" >many1</a>&nbsp;<a href="#letter" >letter</a><br>
</code>
<p>
If the user writes <code>&quot;lexical&quot;</code>, the parser fails with: 
<code>unexpected 'x', expecting 't' in &quot;let&quot;</code>. 
Indeed, since the <code>(&lt;|&gt;)</code>
combinator only tries alternatives when the first alternative hasn't consumed input,
the <code>identifier</code> parser is never tried (because the prefix <code>&quot;le&quot;</code> of the
<code>(string &quot;let&quot;)</code> parser is already consumed). The right behaviour can be obtained
by adding the <code>try</code> combinator:
</p>
<p><code  >expr&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=&nbsp;letExpr&nbsp;&lt;|&gt;&nbsp;identifier&nbsp;&lt;?&gt;&nbsp;&quot;expression&quot;<br>
<br>
letExpr&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=&nbsp;do{&nbsp;try&nbsp;(<a href="#string" >string</a>&nbsp;&quot;let&quot;);&nbsp;...&nbsp;}<br>
identifier&nbsp;&nbsp;=&nbsp;<a href="#many1" >many1</a>&nbsp;<a href="#letter" >letter</a><br>
</code>

<p>Since the use of the <code>try</code> combinator with lexical tokens is quite tricky, the 
<a href="#ParsecToken" >ParsecToken</a> module can be used to parse lexical tokens. This module automatically uses
the try combinator in the appropiate places. 
</p></blockquote>

<blockquote  >The parser <code>p &lt;?&gt; msg</code> behaves as parser <code>p</code>, but whenever
the parser <code>p</code> fails <em>without consuming any input</em>, 
it replaces expect error messages
with the  <a href="#Message" >expect error</a> message <code>msg</code>. 

<p>This is normally used at the end of a set
alternatives where we want to return an error message in terms of a higher level construct
rather than returning all possible characters. For example, if the <code>expr</code> parser 
from the <code  ><a href="#try" >try</a></code> example would fail, the error message is: 
<code>...: expecting expression</code>. Without the <code>(&lt;?&gt;)</code> combinator, the message
would be like <code>...: expecting &quot;let&quot; or letter</code>, which is less friendly.

<code>(notFollowedBy p)</code> only succeeds when parser <code>p</code>
fails. This parser does not consume any input. This parser can be used
to implement the 'longest match' rule. For example, when recognizing 
keywords (for example <code>let</code>), 
we want to make sure that a keyword is not followed by a legal
identifier character, in which case the keyword is actually an identifier (for example <code>lets</code>).
We can program this behaviour as follows:
<p><code  >keywordLet&nbsp;&nbsp;=&nbsp;<a href="#try" >try</a>&nbsp;(do{&nbsp;<a href="#string" >string</a>&nbsp;&quot;let&quot;<br>

<a name="ParsecToken" ><h3  >Module ParsecToken</h3></a>



The extension module <code>ParsecToken</code> is used to parse lexical
tokens (for example: identifiers, comments and numbers). Since
programming languages all have slightly different grammar rules for
lexical tokens, the module should be parameterized with the most
common differences between languages (for example: valid
identifier characters, reserved words etc). 
Since Haskell doesn't have parametrized modules, we resort to a 
trick. The module exports a single function (<code  ><a href="#makeTokenParser" >makeTokenParser</a></code>)
that returns a rather large record that contains all the lexical parse
functions. 

</p><p>Unfortunately, some of those functions (like <code  ><a href="#parens" >parens</a></code>) are polymorphic
which implies that we need to use the <code>forall</code> keyword to give their
type signature inside the record. This keyword is <em>not</em> part of the Haskell98
standard but almost all Haskell systems support it nowadays. You might need to add
some flags to your compiler options to make this work, for example, GHC needs
<code>-fglasgow-exts</code> and Hugs the <code>-98</code> option.
</p>

<p>All lexical features that are not parameterizable are implemented 
according to the Haskell lexical rules
(for example: escape codes and floating point numbers).
Luckily most language grammars match the Haskell grammar on these
tokens quite closely (if not completely).

<blockquote  >The type <code>(PermParser tok st a)</code> denotes a permutation parser that,
when converted by the <code  ><a href="#permute" >permute</a></code> function, parses token streams of type <code>tok</code>
with user state <code>st</code> and returns a value of type <code>a</code> on success.
<p>Normally, a permutation parser is first build with special operators like
<a href="#permor" ><code>(&lt;||&gt;)</code></a> and than transformed into a 
normal parser using <code  ><a href="#permute" >permute</a></code>.

<blockquote  >The parser <code>(permute perm)</code> parses a permutation of parser described
by <code>perm</code>. For example, suppose we want to parse a permutation of:
an optional string of <code>a</code>'s, the character <code>b</code> and an optional <code>c</code>.
This can be described by:
<p><code  >test&nbsp;::&nbsp;<a href="#Parser" >Parser</a>&nbsp;(String,Char,Char)<br>
test&nbsp;&nbsp;=&nbsp;permute&nbsp;(tuple&nbsp;<a href="#permapopt" >&lt;$?&gt;</a>&nbsp;(&quot;&quot;,many1&nbsp;(char&nbsp;'a'))<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#permoropt" >&lt;|?&gt;</a>&nbsp;('_',char&nbsp;'c'))<br>

<code  > :: (a -&gt; b) -&gt; GenParser tok st a -&gt; PermParser tok st b<br>infixl 2</code>
<blockquote  >The expression <code>(f &lt;$$&gt; p)</code> creates a fresh permutation parser
consisting of parser <code>p</code>. The the final result of the permutation parser is
the function <code>f</code> applied to the return value of <code>p</code>. The parser <code>p</code>
is not allowed to accept empty input &ndash; use the optional combinator
<a href="#permapopt" ><code>(&lt;$?&gt;)</code></a> instead.
<p>
If the function <code>f</code>
takes more than one parameter, the type variable <code>b</code> is instantiated to a functional
type which combines nicely with the adds parser <code>p</code> to the 
<a href="#permor" ><code>(&lt;||&gt;)</code></a> combinator. This results in stylized code where
a permutation parser starts with a combining function <code>f</code> followed by
the parsers. The function <code>f</code> gets its parameters in the order in which the
parsers are specified, but actual input can be in any order.

permutation parser <code>perm</code>. The parser <code>p</code>
